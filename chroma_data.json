        "Summer Solstice is a 2005 German-produced two-part television film, a sequel to the 2000 novel Winter Solstice by Rosamunde Pilcher, which was made a television film in 2004. The film, however, is not based on a novel, but was written by Pilcher directly for the screen. It stars Jason Durr, Jacqueline Bisset, Sinéad Cusack, Honor Blackman and Franco Nero.\n\nPlot\nSummer Solstice continues the story from Winter Solstice three years later, in the summertime. As then, the story is set in the Scottish Highlands. Sam and Carrie's newly formed business empire is struggling. The exclusive Rhives Castle Hotel is not attracting enough guests and The Langmore and Highland Gazette, the local newspaper which they own, has run a potentially libellous story concerning best-selling author, Alexia White. On top of everything Carrie has news which surprises Sam. Elfrida gets her big break when she is offered a small part in a soap opera, however, this is going to mean more time away from her beloved Oscar. Meanwhile Lucinda, The Countess of Rhives, is enjoying her new-found lease of life away from the burden of running the castle.\n\nRelease\nThe film was first shown on ZDF in Germany on 25 December 2005. In the United Kingdom, it first received a straight-to-DVD release in 2006, but was later broadcast by Channel 5, with the first airing on 11 June 2012.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nBritish drama television films\n2005 films\n2005 television films\nGerman drama television films\n2005 romantic drama films\nFilms shot in Edinburgh\nEnglish-language German films\nTelevision shows based on British novels\nZDF original programming\nFilms directed by Giles Foster",

        "Central High School is a high school located in uptown Springfield, Missouri. The school, a part of Springfield Public Schools, was Springfield's first high school to be built. Construction of the building was completed in 1893. The first graduating class graduated a year later in 1894 consisting of two out of the 76 seniors that were enrolled. The school was renamed Central High School after the construction of Springfield's second oldest high school, Parkview High School, in 1956. Central's mascot is a Bulldog, named Pug by the students at the time of his creation.  Central is also the home to the Kiltie Drum and Bugle Corps. This corps was created by Robert Ritchie Robertson in 1926, and has the distinction of being the first all-female Scottish pipe and drum corps in the country.\n\nHistory\nConstruction of Central High School began 1893 and was completed in January 1894 at a cost of $100,000.\n\nCampus\n\nCentral has varied structure since its original construction in 1894. The original building is almost fully intact, albeit with many additions, the first of which was the Central Wing added in 1907. The Central Wing was then followed up by the addition of the Eastern Wing in 1913. Following the construction of the Eastern Wing, the Auditorium was constructed in 1940. The most recent addition to the building, the \"New Wing\", was completed in 2002. The construction of the \"New Wing\" drastically improved the nature of the school in adding another building to the campus. The building houses Central's library, various classrooms, and an improved lunchroom.\n\nThe Jim Ball Gymnasium, nicknamed \"The Pit\" for its sunken floor, houses the school's basketball and volleyball games. The Jim Ball Gymnasium is named after the successful Central student and basketball coach, Jim Ball.\n\nSome features of the campus are no longer present. The hallways to Central's auditorium once were home to many ivy plants. The plants were removed in the 1970s for fear of possible damage to the building, but ivy murals were painted on the walls of a hallway to replace them. The hallway became known as the \"Hall of Ivy\". The Hall of Ivy has become a memorial at the school for students who have died.\nThe school originally had a bell tower on the front of the building, however it was removed in 1916 for the strain it placed on the façade.\n\nNotable programs\nCentral High School is one of the eleven high schools in Missouri to offer the IB Diploma Programme. Central High School also features the Springfield Scholars Program (formerly the Middle Years Scholars Program). The program offers accelerated high school classes to gifted middle schoolers. In the program middle schoolers are semi-integrated with the rest of the population and take SSP (Springfield Scholars Program) classes, high school honors classes with the rest of the population along with Pre-IB classes with other high school Pre-IB students.   \nThe school also features the A+ program, a state program that offers College tuition in exchange for tutoring.\n\nCentral Intelligence \nCentral High School's Media II class develops and releases a bi-weekly in-house news program entitled \"Central Intelligence\", sometimes referred to as \"CI\". The program is produced by students for the student body and informs students of local events, both in Springfield and at Central.\n\nCentral Intelligence has received a total of six pacemaker awards and in 2011 received Best of Show at the National Scholastic Press Association show in Minneapolis.\nIn 2012, Central Intelligence again won a pacemaker at the National Scholastic Press Association, this time held in Austin.\n\nNotable alumni\n Bob Barker\n William A.

        "Célia Šašić (; ; born 27 June 1988) is a German former footballer who played as a striker for SC 07 Bad Neuenahr, 1. FFC Frankfurt and the Germany national team before retiring in 2015.\n\nClub career\n\nYouth career and SC 07 Bad Neuenahr\nŠašić began her career at the age of five at TuS Germania Hersel, after her older brother had taken her to a training session. After several clubs at junior level, Šašić joined the Bundesliga side SC 07 Bad Neuenahr in 2004. She quickly became a regular starter and an important player for the club. In 2005, Šašić received the Fritz Walter medal in bronze as the year's third best female junior player. In March 2007, she suffered a fractured tibia in a league game against Bayern Munich, which ended her season. She had been the division's top-scorer up until then.\n\n1. FFC Frankfurt\nIn June 2013, she signed a three-year contract with 1. FFC Frankfurt. She declined the option for the third year on her contract on 12 May 2015 and became a free agent at the end of the 2014–15 season. On 16 July 2015, she announced her retirement at the age of 27.\n\nInternational career\nŠašić held French citizenship through her mother. After the German Football Association had approached her, she became a German citizen at the beginning of 2004. Later that year, she was part of Germany's winning squad at the 2004 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship, scoring three goals in the group stage.\n\nIn January 2005, Šašić made her debut for Germany's senior national team against Australia. She scored her first goal in a friendly match against Canada in September 2006. A tibia fracture ruled her out for the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup. She was part of Germany's squads claiming bronze at the 2008 Summer Olympics and winning the title at the 2009 European Championship, where she scored in the semi-final against Norway. At both tournaments, she was a reserve player with limited playing time. Šašić was called up for the German 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup squad. She was part of the victorious German team at UEFA Women's Euro 2013.\n\nShe was part of the German team at FIFA Women's World Cup 2015. She scored a hat-trick in Germany's opening game against Ivory Coast on 7 June 2015, and would lead the tournament with six goals, scoring twice against Sweden in a 4–1 victory in the Round of 16, along with a penalty kick goal against France in the quarterfinals. However, she went on to miss a vital penalty kick versus the United States in the semifinals as Germany was eliminated. While Carli Lloyd scored three goals in the final to match Šašić's six and both had one assist, the tiebreaker regarding lesser playtime eventually gave Šašić the Golden Boot as the tournament top scorer. She subsequently announced her retirement from football on 17 July 2015.\n\nPersonal life\nŠašić was born in Bonn, Germany, the daughter of a Cameroonian father and a French mother. Her family name \"da Mbabi\" roughly means \"(daughter) of Mbabi\", while \"Okoyino\" derives from her father's grandmother. Because of her long name, she was the only women's Bundesliga player with only her first name on her jersey. However, in the national team, her full family name was displayed.\n\nIn 2007, Šašić graduated with the Abitur diploma at the Friedrich-Ebert-Gymnasium in Bonn. Her majors were Sports and French. Since October 2009, she began studying Cultural studies at the University of Koblenz and Landau. In August 2013 she married the Croatian football player Marko Šašić, the son of Milan Šašić, and decided to use the name Célia Šašić.\n\nŠašić gave birth to her first child, a daughter, after retiring in 2016.\n\nCareer statistics\nScores and results list Germany's goal tally first, score column indicates score after each Šašić goal.\n\nHonours\n\n1.

        "Since 1980, the Republican Party of the United States has held debates between candidates for the Republican nomination in presidential elections during the primary election season. Unlike debates between party-nominated candidates, which have been organized by the bi-partisan Commission on Presidential Debates since 1988, debates between candidates for party nomination are organized by mass media outlets.\n\nParty presidential debates are typically not held when an incumbent president is running for a second term. Although debates were held in advance of the 2020 Republican Party presidential primaries among challengers to incumbent president Donald Trump, the Republican National Committee did not participate in scheduling those debates nor did Trump attend any of those debates.\n\nList of debates\n\n1948\n\nThe Dewey–Stassen debate was the first audio-recorded presidential debate to ever take place in the United States. It featured New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey and former Minnesota Governor Harold Stassen discussing the legal status of Communist Party of the United States four days before the 1948 Oregon Republican presidential primary. The debate transmitted throughout the nation via radio broadcast, and is credited with helping Dewey win the primary and the nomination of his party. It is often cited as establishing the modern presidential debate standard.\n\nThis would prove to be the last time the Republicans held such an event for several decades.\n\n1980\nIn what would be the start of a tradition in open primary campaigns, the first (of six) Republican presidential debate in over 30 years was held in Iowa on January 6, 1980. Former California Governor Ronald Reagan, who was the prohibitive front-runner, chose to bypass the debate. Five of the ten candidates participated: George H. W. Bush, John Anderson, Phil Crane, Bob Dole, and John Connally. The participants openly criticized Reagan for taking the state caucus for granted, which set the stage for a victory by Ambassador Bush. Reagan would participate in all further debates, including the decisive one, the February 23 debate with George Bush which became known as the \"Ambush at Nashua\".\n\nWith Reagan boycotting the Puerto Rico primary in deference to New Hampshire, Bush won the territory easily, giving him an early lead going into New Hampshire.\n\nWith the other candidates in single digits, the Nashua Telegraph offered to host a debate between Reagan and Bush. Worried that a newspaper-sponsored debate might violate electoral regulations, Reagan subsequently arranged to fund the event with his own campaign money, inviting candidates John Anderson, Howard Baker, Phil Crane and Bob Dole to participate at short notice. The Bush camp did not learn of Reagan's decision to include the other candidates until the debate was due to commence. Bush refused to participate, which led to an impasse on the stage. As Reagan attempted to explain his decision, the editor of the Nashua Telegraph ordered the sound man to mute Reagan's microphone. A visibly angry Reagan responded, \"I am paying for this microphone, Mr. Green!\" [sic] (referring to the editor Jon Breen). Eventually the other candidates agreed to leave, and the debate proceeded between Reagan and Bush. Reagan's quote was often repeated as \"I paid for this microphone!\" and dominated news coverage of the event; Reagan sailed to an easy win in New Hampshire.\n\nReagan won New Hampshire in a landslide.\n\nThe final debate took place on April 24, at Houston Civic Center in Texas, and was between Reagan and Bush. The Moderator was Howard K. Smith and it was sponsored by the League of Women Voters.\n\n1987–1988\nOn October 28, 1987 Vice President George H. W. Bush fought off attacks from his Republican rivals Pete du Pont, Al Haig, Bob Dole, Jack Kemp and Pat Robertson in the opening debate of the GOP presidential campaign. It was moderated by William F. Buckley Jr. was joined by former Democratic National Committee chairman Robert S. Strauss.\n\nThe six would debate five more times before Haig dropped out, and then three more, with varying numbers of candidates until Bush rapped up the nomination in March.\n\n1995–1996\nThe debates started on Wednesday, October 11, 1995 in Manchester, NH, with 10 candidates: Governor Lamar Alexander,  Senators Phil Gramm, Bob Dole, Richard Lugar and Arlen Specter; Congressman Bob Dornan; as well as hobbyists Pat Buchanan, Steve Forbes, Alan Keyes and Morry Taylor in attendance.\n\nThere were two in January, three in February, and two in March.\n\n1999–2000\nThe first televised debate took place on October 22, 1999 in Durham, NH. Congressman Gary Bauer, Senators Orrin Hatch and John McCain; as well as Steve Forbes and Alan Keyes participated.\n\nGovernor George W. Bush wouldn't join the group until the third debate, which took place in Manchester, NH on December 2. There were three in December and six in January, by which time, the only viable candidates were Bush and McCain. The final debate took place in Los Angeles, CA on March 2, with Bush, Keyes and McCain on stage.\n\n2007–2008\n\n21 debates were held between the candidates for the Republican nomination for the 2008 United States presidential election. The first debate was held on May 3, 2007 and the final debate was on February 2, 2008. Twelve candidates participated in at least one debate, with the most participants in any one debate being ten. Four candidates participated in at least sixteen debates: Mike Huckabee, John McCain, Ron Paul, and Mitt Romney.\n\n2011–2012\n\nThere were 20 debates held between the candidates for the Republican nomination for the 2012 United States presidential election. The first debate was held on May 5, 2011 and the final debate was on February 22, 2012. Ten candidates participated in at least one debate. The most participants in any one debate was nine, in the September 22, 2011 debate in Orlando, Florida. Four candidates participated in the last four debates: Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul, Mitt Romney, and Rick Santorum. Paul and Santorum were the only candidates to participate in all 20 debates.\n\n2015–2016\n\nThere were 12 debates held between the candidates for the Republican nomination for the 2016 United States presidential election. The first debate was held on August 6, 2015 and the final debate was on March 10, 2016. Due to the large pool of candidates, some debates were split into a primary debate and a secondary debate. Seventeen candidates participated in at least one debate. Four candidates were invited to every debate: Ted Cruz, John Kasich, Marco Rubio, and Donald Trump. Of these, three candidates participated in every debate (Trump declined to participate in the January 28, 2016 debate in Des Moines, Iowa).\n\n2019–2020 \n\nBecause Donald Trump was running for re-election, the Republican National Committee did not schedule any debates for the 2020 Republican Party presidential primaries. However, private organizations held three debates among Trump's challengers, none of which Trump attended. Joe Walsh and Bill Weld participated in all three debates, and Mark Sanford participated in two debates before suspending his campaign. Walsh and Weld eventually suspended their campaigns as well.\n\n2023\n\nSee also\n Democratic Party presidential debates\n United States presidential debates\n\nReferences\n\n \nUnited States presidential debates\nRepublican Party (United States) presidential primaries",

        "Ben Herring (born 14 March 1980) is a professional rugby coach currently Head coach of Toyota Verblitz.  Previously Head coach of the Otago. Herring has coached with two national sides, Canada and Japan, and with  two super franchises.\n\nCoaching career\n\n2009–2011\n\nHerring was appointed assistant coach at Leicester Tigers by director of rugby Richard Cockerill. He had over 60 games as coach, including Heineken Cup semifinals and winning two Premiership titles 2008–09, 2009–10, and beaten finalist 2010–11.\n\n2011–2013\n\nJapanese club side the NEC Green Rockets recruited Herring to coach alongside former Blues head coach Greg Cooper. In his first season NEC finished in third place, their highest finish in Top League history.\n\n2013–2015\n\nHerring was employed by Rugby Canada to coach national representative teams both in 15s and 7s. Herring was assistant to Kieran Crowley with the national 15s team, and Geraint John with the 7s.  The national 7s side reached 6th in the world, its highest ever world ranking. Coached by Herring and John Tait, the national women's 7s team consistently ranked top 3 in the world.\n\n2015–2018\n\nDue to a growing family, Herring returned to New Zealand and became assistant coach for Otago, and a specialist coach for the Highlanders. Jamie Joseph's appointment to coach the Japanese national side saw him take Tony Brown (attack) and Ben Herring (defense) as his two assistant coaches. Herring was also appointed assistant coach to the newly formed Japanese Super team, the Sunwolves, in order to create alignment between the national and Super franchise. Japan exceeded expectations in 2016 finishing the November internationals with a last-minute drop goal loss to Wales at a sold-out Principality Stadium.\n\n2018–2019\n\nWith the arrival of his fourth child, Herring returned to New Zealand, where he was appointed head coach of the Otago team. In 2018 Otago won the Ranfurly shield, New Zealand's oldest trophy. The Otago team made the Championship final.\n\nPlaying career \n\nHerring played professionally from 2001 to 2009 in both New Zealand and England before his retirement through concussion. Herring was a reliable openside flanker and turnover specialist. He began his senior rugby career when he shifted from Auckland to Dunedin to study a Physical Education degree at the University of Otago. He played for the Alhambra-Union club, whose most notable All Black was fellow openside Josh Kronfeld. Herring won Otago club player of the year for his first two seasons, playing fifty games for the club, before being contracted to Southland for the start of his professional career.\n\nIn his debut season for the Southland Stags he was named Southland player of the year, scoring two highly memorable NPC tries off kick-offs. The first was an intercept and an unopposed run to the line off a Southland kick-off, while the second was against Canterbury in a Ranfurly Shield challenge, when he fielded a Canterbury kick-off and ran 60 meters to score. This form won him a Super 12 contract with the Highlanders in 2002. A second season at Southland followed, where by the end of 2003 he had scored seven tries in 22 games.\n\nIn 2004 he transferred to the Hurricanes and Vodafone Wellington Lions replacing the departing Kupu Vanisi. Injury restricted him to only six Super rugby games in his debut season with the Hurricanes. He returned to play a leading role for both the capital sides, forming a regular loose forward trio with Jerry Collins and Rodney So’oialo. After notable highlights against the British and Irish lions and NPC final appearances, Herring took up a contract for European giants Leicester Tigers in 2007.\n\nHerring won Leicester Tigers newcomer of the year in 2008. After 30 Premiership and Heineken Cup appearances, Herring suffered a series of concussions that led to his premature retirement from all rugby in January 2009.\n\nReferences\n\n https://web.archive.org/web/20130208061638/http://hurricanes.co.nz/team/players/ben-herring\n www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/Assistant ...

        "William Brockmann Long (born April 6, 1975) is an American emergency manager who served as the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). He was appointed to the position by President Donald Trump in April 2017 and confirmed by the United States Senate in June 2017. He served until his resignation in March 2019, following criticism of his handling of the Hurricane Maria and an ethical complaint over using official vehicles.\n\nEducation\nLong grew up in Newton, North Carolina, graduating from Newton-Conover High School. He received his B.S. in criminal justice and M.P.A. from Appalachian State University. He also graduated from the Naval Postgraduate School's Executive Leadership Program at the  Center for Homeland Defense and Security.\n\nCareer\nLong was an emergency management official in Georgia, where he served as the Statewide Planner/School Safety Coordinator for the Georgia Emergency Management Agency from September 1999 to November 2001. He worked for the Federal Emergency Management Agency as Hurricane Program Manager from November 2001 to January 2006. Long was the Southeast Regional Director for Beck Disaster Recovery from February 2007 to February 2008.\n\nLong headed the Alabama Emergency Management Agency from 2008 to 2011 under Governor Bob Riley and developed the state's response to the H1N1 influenza. During the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, he was the State Incident Commander for the Alabama Unified Command.\n\nIn 2011, Long joined the emergency management consulting firm Hagerty Consulting, where he was executive vice president.\n\nFEMA Administrator\n\nPresident Donald Trump nominated Long to be administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency on April 28, 2017.\nOn June 20, 2017, he was confirmed by the United States Senate with a vote of 95 to 4.\n\nIn August 2017, Long faced the first major natural disaster of his tenure in the form of Hurricane Harvey. He stated that the hurricane would likely be recorded for Texas as \"the worst disaster the state's seen,\" with the recovery period expected to take \"many years.\" Weeks before, he had told interviewers that his biggest concern was major hurricane preparedness. Long received widespread praise for his handling of the federal response to Hurricane Harvey. He was also criticized for his response to Hurricane Maria.\n\nIn September 2018, Politico reported that Long was under investigation by the FEMA inspector general because he allegedly used government vehicles to commute between Washington, D.C., and his home in Hickory, North Carolina. Politico reported that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, concerned about Long's frequent absences from Washington due to his regular six-hour drives between Washington and Hickory, asked Long to consider resigning his position, which Long declined to do.\n\nIn February 2019, Long announced his resignation as FEMA Administrator, effective March 8, following questions over his use of his government vehicle. His deputy, Peter Gaynor, succeeded him as acting administrator.\n\nPost-FEMA\nBrock returned to Hagerty Consulting as an executive chairman in April 2019.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nBiography at FEMA\n\n1975 births\nAppalachian State University alumni\nFederal Emergency Management Agency officials\nLiving people\nPeople from Hickory, North Carolina\nPeople from Newton, North Carolina\nTrump administration personnel",

        "Union is a subway station on Line 1 Yonge–University of the Toronto subway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It opened in 1954 as one of twelve original stations on the first phase of the Yonge line, the first rapid transit line in Canada. It was the southern terminus of the line until the opening of the University line in 1963, and is today the inflection point of the U-shaped line. Along with Spadina station, it is one of two stations open overnight to support late-night streetcar routes.\n\nUnion station is located on Front Street between the Yonge Street and University Avenue sections of the line. It is named for and directly connects to the railway station and regional bus terminal of the same name, serving all GO Transit train lines and train-bus services as well as Via Rail intercity routes (including Amtrak's Maple Leaf service to New York City). It connects to the Union Pearson Express (UPX), a dedicated rail link to Toronto Pearson International Airport. It is the only subway station with a direct connection to Via services.\n\nBased on Toronto's street grid, Union is the southernmost subway station and the closest to Lake Ontario; however, using standard compass directions, Kipling and Islington stations are further south. It serves approximately 100,000 people a day, ranking it as the fourth-busiest station in the system, after Bloor–Yonge, St. George, and Sheppard–Yonge, and the busiest served by only one line. Adjacent to the subway station is an underground terminal loop for the 509 Harbourfront and 510 Spadina streetcar.\n\nIn 2007, Union subway station became the first location on the TTC where Presto cards could be used, as part of a trial. Wi-Fi service has been available at this station since 2014.\n\nHistory\n\nThe station opened as the southern terminus of the original Yonge subway line on March 30, 1954.\n\nOn February 28, 1963, Union became a through station with the opening of the University section of the Yonge–University line.\n\nOn June 22, 1990, Union became the terminus of route 604 Harbourfront LRT, now part of the 509 Harbourfront and 510 Spadina streetcar routes. A new underground streetcar platform was built south of the subway tracks, connected to the station concourse by a 30-metre pedestrian tunnel and a flight of stairs.\n\nElevators were installed in 1996, making Union one of the first wheelchair-accessible subway stations in Toronto. An elevator was added to the streetcar platforms, even though streetcars were not accessible themselves.  By the time accessible streetcars began serving the station in 2014, the elevator had been replaced as a part of the station expansion.\n\nOn August 18, 2014, a second subway platform was opened to serve Yonge line trains, leaving the existing platform to serve only University line trains.\n\nStation expansion \nIn 2003, planning began on a station expansion to address overcrowding in the station. Despite being one of the busiest stations in the system, the station had only one narrow island platform serving both the University and Yonge lines, and a small concourse area.\n\nThe plan was to build a new subway platform on the south side of the tracks to serve the Yonge portion of the line, leaving the existing island platform to serve only the University portion. This new platform would feature a step-free connection to the streetcar platform. The project also included an expansion of the concourse level, the replacement of all finishes and signage, installation of public art, as well as improved connections to the adjacent Union Station and the PATH network.\n\nAt a cost of $137million, construction began in February 2011, with the new second platform opening on August 18, 2014. The project was completed in 2015 with the completion of the station renovation.\n\nIn 2019, as part of the rebuilding and expansion of the adjacent Union Station, large glass canopies were installed in the \"moat\" that connects the subway station to the rest of the Union station complex. This weather-protected route connecting to the main concourses at Union Station ensures that commuters do not need to go outside when entering or leaving the TTC station.\n\nStation decor\nWhen the station opened in 1954, the wall coverings were glossy yellow Vitrolite tiles with red lettering and trim, and the station name on the walls was in the TTC's unique Toronto Subway Font. During renovations in the 1980s, the yellow Vitrolite tiles were replaced with brown ceramic tiles and vinyl siding, and the station font was changed to Univers.\n\nThe 2011 to 2015 station expansion replaced these tiles and panels with white tiles and black trim, and the font used to render the station name was returned to its original Toronto Subway typeface.\n\nAs part of the second platform project, a glass wall was built to block off the southern side of the old platform, since it now only serves the University line. It features the art piece \"Zones of Immersion\" by Stuart Reid, a professor at the OCAD University The work comprises 166 large glass panels, each measuring more than one by two metres, extending  along the length of the platform. Mostly transparent, it is visible from both the Yonge and University platforms. Each panel contains images or words, many based on sketches that Reid drew while riding the subway. Public reaction towards the art piece has been mixed, with some users of the station finding it \"tragic\" or \"dark and depressing\".\n\nSubway infrastructure in the vicinity\nThe station lies on an east–west axis along Front Street. It is one of three stations on Line 1 with an east–west orientation, the others being  and . Leaving the station eastbound, the Yonge leg of the line runs briefly under Front Street and turns 90 degrees north to run under Yonge Street; leaving westbound, the University leg also runs under Front Street, and shortly after turns 90 degrees north to run under University Avenue.\n\nEntrances\nNorth side entrances:\nStreet-level stairs on north side of Front Street\nUnderground connection from Royal Bank Plaza\nUnderground connection from Brookfield Place\nSouth side entrances:\n2 street-level staircases on south side of Front Street\nConnections via the \"moat\" to the Union railway station\n\nStreetcar loop\n\nUnion Station Loop is located underground at the north end of a  tunnel running under Bay Street through the underground Queens Quay station from the street Queens Quay. The loop runs anticlockwise on a single track along a curved platform. An underground passage connects the streetcar platform to the Yonge subway platform. Union Station Loop is the eastern terminus of the 509 Harbourfront and southern terminus of the 510 Spadina streetcar route. The loop has a minimum radius of curvature of .\n\nA 2017 TTC report stated that the streetcar loop would become inadequate for the volume of customers it handled because of its single track and its curved, narrow platform. The loop would not be able to handle the peak demand of 3700 people per hour projected for 2041. A 2010 environmental assessment for the East Bayfront LRT (a proposed streetcar line) approved rebuilding the existing streetcar loop plus the construction of a connection from the streetcar tunnel to the East Bayfront LRT on Queens Quay East. The LRT design would have rebuilt the loop to have four platforms, each with a bypass track, so that a streetcar could bypass other streetcars loading or unloading. Expansion of the loop's capacity would be needed in order to support an East Bayfront LRT. In 2017, conversion of the tunnel under Bay Street to operate a funicular shuttle to Queens Quay station instead of streetcars was considered but ultimately rejected. , the conversion of the streetcar loop into a four-platform configuration is in the design stage.\n\nNearby landmarks\nNearby landmarks include the Union Station railway station, the Royal York Hotel, Scotiabank Arena, Rogers Centre, the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, the CN Tower, Royal Bank Plaza, Brookfield Place, the Hockey Hall of Fame, and the Meridian Hall.\n\nSurface connections\n\nA direct connection between the subway and streetcars within the fare-paid zone is provided for these routes:\n\nAccess to these routes is also available while the subway is not running, as the station is open overnight.\n\nA transfer is required to connect between the subway or streetcars and these bus routes at curbside stops:\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n Stuart Reid – \"Zones of Immersion\" union station toronto,[sic] anticipated completion 2014\n History of Union station at Transit Toronto\n\nLine 1 Yonge–University stations\nToronto streetcar loops\nPATH (Toronto)\nRailway stations in Canada opened in 1954\n1954 establishments in Ontario",

        "Datuk Seri Utama Tengku Adnan bin Tengku Mansor (Jawi: تڠكو عدنان بن تڠكو منصور; born 20 December 1950) is a Malaysian politician who served as Minister of Federal Territories, Minister of Tourism and Minister in the Prime Minister's Department in the Barisan Nasional (BN) administration under former Prime Ministers Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and Najib Razak from November 2002 to the collapse of the BN administration in May 2018, Member of Parliament (MP) for Putrajaya from March 2004 to November 2022. He is a member of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), a component party of the BN coalition. He has served as the Treasurer-General of UMNO since June 2018. He also served as Secretary-General of UMNO from March 2009 to June 2018.\n\nIn 2018, he was charged with corruption for allegedly accepting bribe by a businessman, which he denied. In 2020, he was convicted and sentenced to jail. The conviction was overturned on appeal in 2021.\n\nEarly life and education\nBorn in Malacca, Malaysia, Adnan obtained a Diploma in Business Administration from Mara Technology Institute (), which is now known as Universiti Teknologi MARA (), and a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) from the University of Southern California.\n\nAdnan held important positions in the corporate sector, such as Director and Chairman of Far East Asset (FEA) and Chairman of UNZA Holdings Bhd.\n\nPolitical career\nAdnan joined politics in the early 1980s. He became Treasurer of the UMNO Youth wing in 1988. He was elected to the UMNO Supreme Council in 1993 but lost the position in 1996. He was appointed as Federal Territory liaison chairman in June 2000. On 29 November 2001, he was appointed the Chairman of the Federal Territory Barisan Nasional. In 2003, he was appointed the Chief of the Putrajaya UMNO, and later he won the position again uncontested in the party election in June 2004. In September 2004, he was successful in a bid for an UMNO Supreme Council seat.\n\nAdnan won the Parliamentary seat of Putrajaya in the March 2004 general election by defeating Abdul Rahman Othman of Parti Keadilan Rakyat (KeADILan).\n\nAdnan was appointed as the Tourism Minister, replacing Datuk Dr. Leo Michael Toyad, on 14 February 2006. He was dropped from the cabinet following the March 2008 general election, where the ruling Barisan Nasional coalition received a serious drubbing at the polls.\n\nAfter his victory for third time in 2013 general election, Adnan has returned to the cabinet and appointed as Minister of the Federal Territories.\n\nIn the 2018 general election, Adnan was reelected to the Parliament. However, he lost his cabinet post as BN was relegated to opposition while the federal government was taken over by Pakatan Harapan (PH).\n\nCorruption case \nOn 15 November 2018, Tengku Adnan pleaded not guilty for accepting RM2 million from Aset Kayamas director Chai Kin Kong via cheque deposited to Tadmansori Holding which Tengku Adnan had interests in. He was allowed bail of RM1 million.\n\nOn 2 July 2019, the trial began. 23 witnesses called including Chai and former Kuala Lumpur City Hall mayors, Ahmad Phesal Talib and  Mohd Amin Nordin.\n\nOn 17 July 2019, Chai took out RM2 million receipt from his wallet which he said is evidence of payment by Umno, to show the sum is for political donation. “Yes, it is in my pocket now” – he said when asked by lead counsel Tan Hock Chuan if he kept any such document.\n\nOn 14 October 2019, Tengku Adnan ordered by the High Court to enter his defence on the corruption charges against him.\n\nOn 17 January and 5 March 2020, Tengku Adnan’s defence proceedings were held for two days. He admitted receiving a RM2 million cheque from Chai for the expense of the Barisan Nasional election campaign on 14 June 2016. But, he did not report this to the party hierarchy as the money has nothing to do with Umno HQ.\n\nOn 30 June 2020, Tengku Adnan was the first defence witness and the defence closed its case after calling four witnesses.\n\nOn 21 December 2020, Judge Mohamed Zaini Mazlan said defence failed to challenge evidence brought by the prosecution. Tengku Adnan found guilty for receiving RM2 million of graft from Chai. He was sentenced to jail, fined RM2 million.\n\nOn 13 January 2021, Tengku Adnan was found guilty of a RM2 million graft charge towards the year-end, but was discharged on a charge involving RM1 million only a fortnight earlier.\n\nOn 25 January 2021, Tengku Adnan filed an appeal on 21 December last year against his conviction.\n\nOn 22 April 2021, the Court of Appeal is hearing an appeal by Tengku Adnan against his conviction for receiving RM2 million in kickbacks from Chai Kin Kong. Chai had testified that the funds were a political donation, but the High Court judge did not accept this. Tengku Adnan's counsel is arguing that the judge was wrong in not accepting Chai's testimony and that the receipt issued to the businessman for the funds shows that the payment was a political donation. The prosecution is arguing that the receipt was fabricated and that Chai was not impeached as a witness because he was recognised as biased towards Tengku Adnan. The court has adjourned to consider its decision.\n\nOn 22 April 2021, the judge overturned the conviction of Tengku Adnan on corruption charges. The original conviction was based on the testimony of Chai Kin Kong, who said that Adnan had received a RM2 million payment from him. However, the judge ruled that there was not enough evidence to prove that Adnan had actually received the money, and that the payment may have been for political donations instead.\n\nControversies and issues\n\nLingam Videoclip controversy\n\nAdnan was called to testify in front of a Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Lingam Video Clip investigating the allegation of illegal intervention in the appointment process of Malaysian judges that allegedly occurred in 2002. The formation of the commission was a follow-up to a recommendation by a three-man panel which was tasked to determine the authenticity of a video clip of a telephone conversation that raised the allegation.\n\nFollowing the findings of the Royal Commission, the Malaysian cabinet ordered the Attorney-General to immediately direct agencies to investigate the allegations levelled against six prominent individuals identified in the Lingam video clip affair. The six are former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, retired chief justices Mohd Eusoff Chin and Ahmad Fairuz Sheikh Abdul Halim, former minister in the Prime Minister's Department Tengku Adnan Mansor, tycoon Vincent Tan and prominent lawyer V. K. Lingam.\n\nThere was sufficient cause to invoke the Sedition Act 1948, the Prevention of Corruption Act 1961, the Legal Profession Act 1976, the Official Secrets Act 1972 and the Penal Code against some of the principal individuals involved, however as of recently, no action has been taken by the Barisan Nasional government against the individuals involved.\n\nFemale bloggers controversy\nAdnan was involved in controversy with regards to a statement he made about female bloggers where he was quoted as calling female bloggers liars. This caused an uproar among the blogger community and attracted a lot of negative reactions. He was quoted as saying in Malaysian Chinese newspaper Sin Chew Daily and Singaporean English daily, the Straits Times:\n\nFederal territories expansion proposal\nIn 2017 Tengku Adnan participated in a radio interview in which he discussed his plan to expand the federal territories to include Penang, Langkawi and parts of Malacca. he explained that his goal was to \"ensure equal development in the northern state\".\n\nTax evasion\nOn 24 July 2019, the government had filed a lawsuit through the Inland Revenue Board (IRB), against Adnan to claim RM57.17 million in unpaid taxes since 2012 till 2017.\n\nTitle controversy\nAdnan claims that his title is not from Malaysia but hereditary from a line of Aceh warriors.\n\nPersonal life\nAdnan is married to Datin Seri Utama Enny Beatrice Ferlat Kusumo Anggraini. They have two sons and four daughters; Iqbal, Natasya, Hafiz,  Nadira, Najwa and Nabila. Adnan has two sons and two daughters from his previous marriage; Daud, Balqish, Yazir and Nadiah.\n\nElection results\n\nHonours\n :\n Officer of the Order of the Defender of the Realm (KMN) (1992)\n Commander of the Order of Meritorious Service (PJN) – Datuk (2000)\n  :\n  Grand Knight of the Order of the Territorial Crown (SUMW) – Datuk Seri Utama (2011)\n  :\n  Knight Companion of the Order of Loyalty to the Royal House of Kedah (DSDK) – Dato' (1997)\n  :\n  Knight Grand Commander of the Order of the Life of the Crown of Kelantan (SJMK) – Dato' (2003)\n  :\n  Companion Class I of the Exalted Order of Malacca (DMSM) – Datuk (2000)\n  Grand Commander of the Exalted Order of Malacca (DGSM) – Datuk Seri (2005)\n  :\n  Knight Companion of the Order of the Crown of Pahang (DIMP) – Dato' (1988)\n  Knight Companion of the Order of Sultan Ahmad Shah of Pahang (DSAP) – Dato' (1990)\n  Grand Knight of the Order of the Crown of Pahang (SIMP) – formerly Dato', now Dato' Indera (2003)\n  Grand Knight of the Order of Sultan Ahmad Shah of Pahang (SSAP) – Dato' Sri (2006)\n  :\n  Grand Commander of the Order of Kinabalu (SPDK) – Datuk Seri Panglima (2017)\n\nSee also\nPutrajaya (federal constituency)\n\nReferences\n\n Utusan Malaysia, 15 February 2006\n\nOfficers of the Order of the Defender of the Realm\nCommanders of the Order of Meritorious Service\n1950 births\nLiving people\nPeople from Malacca\nMalaysian people of Malay descent\nMalaysian people of Acehnese descent\nMalaysian Muslims\nUnited Malays National Organisation politicians\nMembers of the Dewan Rakyat\nMembers of the Dewan Negara\nGovernment ministers of Malaysia\nMarshall School of Business alumni\nGrand Commanders of the Order of Kinabalu\n21st-century Malaysian politicians",

        "Trousseau sign of latent tetany is a medical sign observed in patients with low calcium. From 1 to 4 percent of normal patients will test positive for Trousseau's sign of latent tetany. This sign may be positive before other manifestations of hypocalcemia such as hyperreflexia and tetany, as such it is generally believed to be more sensitive (94%) than the Chvostek sign (29%) for hypocalcemia.\n\nTo elicit the sign, a blood pressure cuff is placed around the arm and inflated to a pressure greater than the systolic blood pressure and held in place for 3 minutes. This will occlude the brachial artery. In the absence of blood flow, the patient's hypocalcemia and subsequent neuromuscular irritability will induce spasm of the muscles of the hand and forearm. The wrist and metacarpophalangeal joints flex, the DIP and PIP joints extend, and the fingers adduct. The sign is also known as main d'accoucheur (French for \"hand of the obstetrician\") because it supposedly resembles the position of an obstetrician's hand in delivering a baby.\n\nHistory\nThe sign is named after French physician Armand Trousseau, who described the phenomenon in 1861. It is distinct from the Trousseau sign of malignancy, which is a type of abnormal blood clot due to certain types of cancer.\n\nReferences\n\nSymptoms and signs: Endocrinology, nutrition, and metabolism",

        "The Lincoln Statue is an historic structure located on the grounds of the Greene County Courthouse in Jefferson, Iowa, United States. It was erected in 1918, and individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. In 2011 it was included as a contributing property in the Jefferson Square Commercial Historic District.\n\nHistory\nThis was the first statue of Abraham Lincoln built beside, and dedicated to, the Lincoln Highway. The statue is a replica of W. Granville Hastings' statue in Cincinnati, Ohio, and was a gift of Mr. and Mrs. E.B. Wilson. The bronze statue is life size, and it stands on a two-tiered concrete base. The lower base features a pebblestone finish, and the upper portion is faced with  of granite. A bronze plaque with the closing paragraph of Lincoln's second inaugural address is affixed to the upper portion of the base.\n\nThe Wilsons decided to donate the statue when the present courthouse was completed in 1917. Because they had no children they reasoned they should give something substantial to the community. The Greene County Board of Supervisors agreed to pay half the cost of the base. The Bureau Brothers Foundry of Philadelphia was contracted to create the statue, and they included the plaque at no expense. It was originally planned that the statue would stand atop a base of pink granite from Pipestone, Minnesota. However, because of World War I the War Industries Board, refused to permit the quarrying and carving the stone until the war was over. The Capitol Hill Monument Company of Des Moines erected a temporary concrete base for the statue's dedication on September 22, 1918. The \"temporary\" base was replaced in 1964. The Iowa State Highway Commission Service Bulletin and the Lincoln Highway Forum used a photograph of the new statue on the cover of their publications in 1918. The Lincoln Highway placed an image of the statue on its mission statement in 1920.\n\nSee also\nList of statues of Abraham Lincoln\nLincoln Highway in Greene County, Iowa\nList of sculptures of presidents of the United States\n\nReferences\n\n1918 sculptures\nJefferson, Iowa\nBuildings and structures in Greene County, Iowa\nMonuments and memorials in Iowa\nJefferson, Iowa\nMonuments and memorials on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa\nLincoln Highway\nNational Register of Historic Places in Greene County, Iowa\nMonuments and memorials to Abraham Lincoln in the United States\nIndividually listed contributing properties to historic districts on the National Register in Iowa",

        "James Finley Watson (March 15, 1840 – June 12, 1897) was an American judge and politician in Oregon. A native of Iowa, he was the 25th associate justice of the Oregon Supreme Court serving from 1876 until 1878. Previously he served in the state legislature and later served as United States Attorney for the District of Oregon.\n\nEarly life\nJames Finley Watson was born on March 15, 1840, in Dubuque, Iowa, to James and Emily Watson. In 1853, the family relocated to Douglas County in Oregon Territory. Watson then was educated in Eugene, Oregon at Columbia College before it closed after two major fires. After attempting gold mining he would learn the law under Rufus Mallory in Roseburg, Oregon, with admittance to the legal bar in 1863. He then served as a prosecutor for Oregon’s Second Judicial District from 1864 to 1872.\n\nPolitical career\nIn 1872, Watson was elected to the Oregon State Senate as a Republican from Douglas County. He won re-election in 1874 to the same seat in the senate. Next, in 1876 Watson won election to the Oregon Supreme Court to replace John Burnett. His term ended in 1878 and he left the bench, however, his younger brother Edward B. Watson would join the court in 1880.\n\nIn 1878, the circuit court functions of the Oregon Supreme Court were split off and a separate circuit court was created with the number of judges on the high court reduced from five to three. The following year Watson was appointed to the circuit court where he won re-election in 1880 and served until 1882.\n\nLater life\nIn 1882, Watson was appointed by the United States President to the position of U.S. District Attorney for the District of Oregon.

        "Christiania Burgher School (Christiania Borger- og Realskole or Christiania Borgerskole, commonly known as Borgerskolen) was a private middle school in Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. It was founded in 1812 and prepared pupils for enrolment at Oslo Cathedral School.\n\nThe school was funded by tuition and throughout the 19th century, its pupils belonged to affluent families, such as the bourgeoisie and higher state officials. In the 20th century, the school received municipal subsidies and thus also pupils from less affluent backgrounds were able to attend. The school was closed down in 1932.\n\nReferences\n\n1812 establishments in Norway\n1932 disestablishments in Norway\nEducational institutions established in 1812\nEducational institutions disestablished in 1932\nSchools in Oslo\nSecondary schools in Norway\nHistory of Oslo",

        "Frederic Gordon Foster (24 February 1921 – 20 December 2010) was an Irish computational engineer, statistician, professor, and college dean who is widely known for devising, in 1965, a nine-digit code upon which the International Standard Book Number (ISBN) is based.\n\nLife \nFoster was born in Belfast, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, between 1920 enactment and 1921 implementation of the partition of Ireland. He studied at the Royal Belfast Academical Institution and began advanced study in mathematics at Queen's University Belfast. During World War II, he was recruited from Queen's by MI6 to work as a code-breaker at Bletchley Park.\n\nAfter the war he resumed studies at Magdalen College, Oxford. A lecture on feedback control by Norbert Wiener, regarded as the originator of cybernetics, proved to be a great influence on Foster's \nresearch.  Upon completing his PhD at Magdalen, he accepted an offer to lecture on his research at the University of Manchester, where he met Alan Turing, a Bletchley Park veteran who became known as the father of computer science. Turing introduced him to the Manchester Mark I computer and enlisted his help working on it. In 1956 Foster joined the faculty of the London School of Economics (LSE), first as an assistant lecturer in statistics, then lecturer and reader. In 1964, he was appointed to the chair of computational methods. While at LSE he helped develop operations research as an academic discipline.\n\nMost noteworthy, in 1965 while at the LSE, Gordon Foster was commissioned by WH Smith, the book publisher and bookseller, to develop a computerised filing system as part of the publisher's drive to modernise its growing company. Gordon Foster developed for WH Smith, a 9 digit code which he named the Standard Book Numbering System (SBN). This code was very successful and was rapidly adopted by all UK publishers and booksellers. In 1970, the International Standard Organisation (ISO) expanded the SBN to 10 digits by adding an initial zero and the code was renamed to become the International Book Numbering System: ISBN.\n\nThe ISBN was born, and is now used worldwide by all publishers and booksellers.\n\nIn 1967 Gordon Foster was asked by Trinity College Dublin to start a Department of Statistics, and became professor of statistics at Trinity College Dublin. He promoted statistical analysis and computer applications in several constituent schools and academic departments. He fostered a lively forward thinking postgraduate and undergraduate program, with courses highly applicable to current statistical problems of the day. He also set up the Statistics and Operations Research Laboratory, known for outreach to industry and public services. He was elected a fellow of Trinity College Dublin in 1971 and Dean of Engineering and System Sciences.\n\nFoster died in Dublin, 20 December 2010.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Oxford Dictionary of National Biography\n Death Notice for FOSTER, Frederic Gordon\n\n1921 births\n2010 deaths\nAcademics of Trinity College Dublin\nIrish cryptographers\nIrish statisticians\nCyberneticists\nFellows of Trinity College Dublin\nProbability theorists\nSystems scientists\nBletchley Park people\n20th-century Irish mathematicians\n21st-century Irish mathematicians",

        "Keef Trouble (born Keith Trussell, 1949, Greenwich, London) is an English singer, songwriter and musician.\n\nCareer\nTrouble studied at The Slade School of Fine Art, London, from 1968 to 1972. He is a founding member of British country-blues band Brett Marvin and the Thunderbolts as vocalist, guitarist, and player of the Zobstick (also known as the Lagerphone or Monkey stick), and electric ironing board. Commercial success came in 1972 under the guise of Terry Dactyl and the Dinosaurs with Seaside Shuffle with fellow band members Graham Hine, John Randall, and Jona Lewie (of \"Stop the Cavalry\" notability). This record became a hit in Europe and Australia, and reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart.\nTrouble is also part of, and writes original material for, the folk rock band Okee Dokee, which plays within West Sussex and Kent, including the Broadstairs Folk Week. He has self-produced two solo albums, Oasis and Kix 4 U, under his own Sun House Records, and has collaborated with Tony O'Malley, previously from the bands 10cc, Kokomo (band) and Arrival, writing the lyrics for O'Malley's \"Mr. Operator\" and \"Naked Flame\". O'Malley has also contributed to Trouble's recordings, as have artists such as saxophonist Mel Collins (Roxy Music, Rolling Stones, The Grease Band), guitarist Neil Hubbard, and vocalists Dyan Birch, Paddy McHugh and Frank Collins. In 2008 Trouble produced the Brett Marvin and the Thunderbolts' album Keep on Moving; co-producer and audio engineer was Pete Ker, who produced The Motors, Man, and Arthur Brown, co-writing Brown's \"Fire\".\n\nTrouble co-wrote the lyrics to Jona Lewie's 1980 hit \"You'll Always Find Me in the Kitchen at Parties\".\n\nThe recording of Oasis and Mix ‘n’ Mingle\n\nTrouble's association with Jona Lewie goes back to 1969, and later both were members of Terry Dactyl and the Dinosaurs. In 1986 the first recordings of Trouble's Oasis and Mix 'n’ Mingle for the album Oasis took place at Lewie's home studio in Streatham, with keyboard musician, arranger and composer Tony O'Malley, guitarist Neil Hubbard and engineer Pete Ker, producer for Arthur Brown and co-writer of Brown's \"Fire\". Trouble had secured a 45rpm single record deal with Rodd Buckle (Habana Music) for the release and distribution of Mix 'n’ Mingle. Because of master tape release difficulties and lateness of the production at the Lewie studio, the record deal fell. Oasis was re-recorded by Ker at a professional recording studio, Ferry Sound.\n\nThe zob stick\nAlthough it is an accepted and commonly used name for this type of instrument, the 'zob stick' as a term has a definitive and recent origin. In the late 1960s, Trouble built a percussion instrument that he used in his blues band Brett Marvin and the Thunderbolts. He invented a name for it, zob stick, with its use being termed 'zobbing'. It was largely based on the traditional folk music instruments monkey stick, ugly stick and lagerphone (Australian). After constructing his version of the instrument, the term 'zob' was used because of its risqué connotation as British naval slang, this suggested by fellow Brett Marvin band member, and ex-seaman, Jim Pitts. The instrument caused amusement when it was introduced in performance in France, where 'zob' has a similar meaning.\n\nThe Trouble zob stick construction uses a pole that is covered with typical partially nailed-in rattle-capable beer bottle caps. A circular solid wooden ring, edged with bottle caps, is added near the top of the pole, with a hand grip section beneath. All the wooden parts are brightly painted. At the bottom a boot, supported by an internal wooden block, is added, with a metal spring attached to the sole. The spring serves no musical purpose but has comedy potential. Halfway up the pole is a sleeved-on metal tube for greater volume and a crisper percussive sound. The Zob Stick is rhythmically bounced on the floor and the metal sleeve hit with a wooden stick. The stick itself, (usually an adapted hockey stick because of its durability,) is serrated to achieve a scraping sound effect when necessary.  Although the resultant construction is heavy, requiring strength for continual use, this weight gives it a volume and 'clout' that the traditional monkey stick might not match, especially in a live and loud band situation.\n\nAs Dougie Damone\n\nA composition, \"Hello Mum\", had been recorded at Ferry Sound in the early 1990s. The recording was released in the UK and sold as a 7-inch vinyl single and greeting's card for Mother's Day in 1992 under the CoverHit label, with the pseudonym 'Dougie Damone'. In 2008, the song was reproduced as a YouTube video which, with the song, was reviewed in the Mid Sussex Times.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Keef Trouble on video\nKeef Trouble interviews Nick Tesco\n Keef Trouble interviews Frank Collins\n Keef Trouble interviews Andy Newmark\n Keef Trouble interviews Neil Hubbard\n The Lagerphones Pages Keith Sayers, Canberra, Australia.\n Brett Marvin and the Thunderbolts Web Site featuring Keef Trouble and the original 'Zob Stick.'\n The Freedom Boot The Groanbox Boys, London, United Kingdom.\n\n1949 births\nLiving people\nAlumni of the Slade School of Fine Art\nEnglish rock musicians\nEnglish blues musicians\nEnglish pop musicians\nMusicians from Greenwich\nArticles with topics of unclear notability from November 2020",

        "Antoine Louis Léocardie Élie Lescot (; December 9, 1883 – October 20, 1974) was the President of Haiti from May 15, 1941 to January 11, 1946. He was a member of the country's mixed-race elite. He used the political climate of World War II to sustain his power and ties to the United States, Haiti's powerful northern neighbor. His administration presided over a period of economic downturn and harsh political repression of dissidents.\n\nEarly life\nLescot was born in Saint-Louis-du-Nord to a middle-class mixed-race family, descended from free persons of color in the colonial era. He traveled to Port-au-Prince to study pharmacy after completing his secondary education in Cap-Haïtien. He settled in Port-de-Paix to work in the export-import business.\n\nAfter his first wife died in 1911, Lescot entered politics. He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies two years later. After a four-year stay in France during the United States occupation of Haiti (1915 to 1934), he returned and held posts in the Louis Borno and Sténio Vincent administrations. Four years later he was named ambassador to the neighboring Dominican Republic, where he forged an alliance with President Rafael Trujillo. He moved to Washington, D.C., after being appointed as ambassador to the United States.\n\nWartime election\nHis close political and economic ties to the United States helped lay the groundwork for his ascendancy to Haiti's presidency, and he received the State Department's tacit backing for his campaign to succeed Sténio Vincent in 1941. Prominent members of the Chamber of Deputies opposed his candidacy, arguing Haiti needed a black president from a majority African ancestry. Taking the advantage of Trujillo's influence, Lescot was said to buy his way into power. He won 56 out of 58 votes cast by legislators. Deputy Max Hudicourt claimed the margin of victory was due to intimidation and beatings of legislators.\n\nLescot quickly moved to consolidate his control over the state apparatus, naming himself head of the Military Guard and appointing a clique of white and mixed-race members of the elite to major government posts, including his own sons. This action earned him great disdain among Haiti's large majority of ethnic Africans.\n\nAfter the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Lescot declared war on the Axis Powers and pledged all necessary support to the Allied war effort. His government offered refuge to European Jews on Haitian soil in cooperation with Trujillo. In 1942 Lescot claimed the war required the suspension of the constitution and had the parliament give him unlimited executive powers. Political opponents were subject to physical harassment and surveillance by security forces.\n\nFailed rubber cultivation program\n\nAs an Axis blockade cut off rubber supplies from the East, Lescot's administration began an ambitious program, in cooperation with the United States, to expand wartime production of rubber in the Haitian countryside. The Export-Import Bank in Washington granted $5 million in 1941 for the development of rubber plants in Haiti. The program was called the Société Haïtiano-Américane de Développement Agricole (SHADA) and managed by American agronomist Thomas Fennell.\n\nSHADA began production in 1941 with the provision of ample military support per contract with the US government. By 1943, an estimated  were cleared for the planting of cryptostegia vine, which was considered to yield high amounts of latex. The program eventually claimed over 100,000 hectares of land. Farmers in Haiti's northern countryside were lured from food crop cultivation to meet increasing demand for rubber.\n\nLescot energetically campaigned on SHADA's behalf, arguing the program would modernize Haitian agriculture. The United States also promoted the project with a robust public relations campaign. Peasant families were forcibly removed from Haiti's most arable tracts of land. After nearly a million fruit-bearing trees in Jérémie were cut down and peasant houses invaded or razed, the Haitian Minister of Agriculture, Maurice Dartigue, wrote to Fennell asking him to respect \"the mentality and legitimate interests of the Haitian peasant and city-dwellers.\"\nBut yields did not meet expectations, and insufficient amounts of rubber were produced to generate significant exports. Droughts contributed to poor harvests.\n\n\"The worst thing that can be said of SHADA is that they are doing [their operations] at considerable expense to the American taxpayer and in a manner that does not command the respect of the Haitian people\", concluded a survey by the US military. The US government offered $175,000 as compensation to displaced peasants after recommending the program's cancellation.\n\nLescot feared SHADA's termination would add the burden of higher unemployment (at its height it employed over 90,000 people) to a sinking economy and hurt his public image. He asked the Rubber Development Corporation to extend its closing of the program gradually until the end of the war, but was refused.\n\nDecline and exile\n\nWith his government near bankruptcy and struggling with a flagging economy, Lescot pleaded unsuccessfully with the United States for an extension on debt repayments. Relations between Lescot and Trujillo in the Dominican Republic broke down. In Haiti he expanded the corps of the Military Guard, including a core of light-skinned commanding officers. A system of rural police chiefs, known as chefs de section, ruled by force and intimidation. In 1944 low-ranking black soldiers plotting rebellion were caught, and seven of them were executed without court-martial.\n\nThat same year Lescot extended his presidential term from five years to seven. By 1946, his attempts to muzzle the opposition press sparked fierce student demonstrations; a revolt broke out in Port-au-Prince.  Black-empowerment noirists, Marxists, and populist leaders joined forces in opposition. Crowds protested outside the National Palace, workers went on strike, and the homes of authorities were ransacked. Lescot's mulatto-dominated government was highly resented by Haiti's predominantly black military Garde.\n\nLescot tried to order the Military Guard to break up the demonstrations, but was rebuffed. Convinced their lives were in danger, Lescot and his cabinet fled into exile. A three-person military junta took power in his place and pledged to organize elections. In the immediate aftermath of Lescot's exile, an independent radio and print press flourished and long-repressed dissident groups expressed optimism about Haiti's future. Dumarsais Estimé eventually succeeded Lescot as head of the republic, becoming Haiti's first black president since the US occupation.\n\nReferences\n\n Smith, Matthew J.

        "Sir Sidney Job Pocock  (20 September 1855 – 1931) was a British businessman, magistrate, writer, Liberal Party politician and an authority on prisons.\n\nBackground\nPocock was born the son of Abraham Pocock and Lydia née Keevil of Stanford Park, Berkshire.\n\nIn 1890 he married Annie Cousens (d.1900). They had one son and three daughters.\n\nIn 1915 he married Kate Ethel Lankester (d.1925).\n\nPocock was knighted in 1912. On 28 April 1931 he died at Surbiton Hall, Kingston upon Thames, at the age of 76. His probate was resworn the next year at . His columnar gravestone at Wimbledon is surmounted by a cornice and large shrouded urn or amphora.\n\nProfessional career\nPocock inherited an interest in farming. He made his career as a businessman. He was prominent in the dairy industry. In 1907 he was appointed a Justice of the Peace for Middlesex and presided over the Spelthorne Petty Sessions. His experiences as a Magistrate led him to take a particular interest in the prison system. He visited many prisons, recording his observations and experiences which he had published in 1930, under the title 'The Prisoner and the Prison'.\n\nPolitical career\nPocock was a member of the Eighty Club, a political London gentlemen's club which had a strong association with the Liberal Party. He was Liberal candidate for the Uxbridge division of Middlesex at the 1906 General Election. Uxbridge was a safe Conservative seat, so much so that no Liberal candidate contested the previous general elections in 1895 and 1900. The Liberals swept to power nationally and the tide nearly took Pocock into parliament. He lost by just 145 votes. Four years later, at the January 1910 General Election, he once again contested Uxbridge but this time the Conservative won comfortably. Later that year, he switched constituencies and was Liberal candidate for the Devizes division of Wiltshire at the December 1910 General Election. Devizes was a better seat for the Liberals, they had won it in 1906. The Conservatives had won it back in January 1910. Pocock was unable to wrestle the seat back and the Conservative held on by just over 700 votes. He did not stand for parliament again.\n\nElectoral record\n\nReferences\n\n1855 births\n1931 deaths\nLiberal Party (UK) parliamentary candidates\nEnglish justices of the peace",

        "Petra White is an Australian poet. White was born in Adelaide in 1975, the eldest of six children, and now lives in Berlin with her husband and daughter. Her first published collection of poetry, The Incoming Tide (John Leonard Press 2007), was shortlisted for the Queensland Premier's Literary Awards and the ACT Poetry Prize.\n\nIn 2011, five of White's poems were selected for inclusion in the landmark anthology of Australian Poetry, Australian Poetry Since 1788. The poems selected are Ricketts Point, Voyage, Woman and Dog, Older Sister and Notes for the Time Being.\n\nBiography \nPetra White grew up in Adelaide. She studied English and German literature at the University of Melbourne, completing a BA with honours. In 2002 she studied at Essen University and travelled widely in Europe. In 2008 she was Fellow of Hawthornden Castle International Retreat for Writers, completing a five-week residency.\n\nIn 2012, White and Paul Hetherington took Australian poetry to Ireland with Australian Poetry Limited's first international tour. White conducted readings and workshops at many venues throughout the Republic and Northern Ireland including the Bealtaine Festival in Dublin, Laurel Villa in Magherafelt and Writers' Week at Listowel.\n\nWhite's second collection, The Simplified World, published in 2010, was the joint winner of the Grace Leven Prize for Poetry. Her work has appeared in the anthology Take Five (Shoestring Press 2008, UK), The Age, Melbourne, and other anthologies and periodicals.\n\nA third major collection, A Hunger, was published by John Leonard Press in 2014. This publication includes White's previous collections, in which slight changes have been made to a small number of poems.\n\nIn May 2017, White's fourth collection, Reading for a Quiet Morning, was published by GloriaSMH Press. It features a 'compact epic' inspired by the biblical story of Ezekiel, but with a distinctly twenty-first century, feminist perspective.\n\nWhite was a founding co-editor of the So Long Bulletin, a blog on Australian poetry and criticism. She was the judge for the Reason-Brisbane Poetry Prize in 2011.\n\nWhite holds a master's degree in Public Policy and Management from the University of Melbourne. In 2018, she moved to Europe, initially to London, then to Berlin, where she completed her fifth collection, titled 'Cities', published in 2021 by Sydney-based Vagabond Press.\n\nWorks\n\nCritical reception \n\"With her unpretentious voice and subject matter, Petra draws the reader to her and absorbs them with tales of her multifaceted life.\"\n\n'Sister', from The Incoming Tide, \"is a lovely, almost comically surprising poem whose essential structure is that it is about sisterhood only in its title and its last two lines. As the poem progresses through four eight-line stanzas the gap between the title and the content of the poem grows more and more intense so that the conclusion is that much more satisfying:\"\n\nDescendant of the Aztec dog-god\nXolotl, who with mangled hands and feet\nguided the dead to heaven, his once trans-\nlucent form refuses catastrophe; more\nthan the ailing tabby, the timorous\nand watchful high-heeled dog, or the rented\nfireprone house, he guards our dangerous\nchildhood pledge to never change.\n\n\"It is one of those rare poems which is simultaneously sophisticated and easy to grasp: it should be immediately anthologized.\"\n\n\"In The Simplified World Petra White more than fulfils the promise made by her first book, The Incoming Tide, back in 2007. For all of her literary sophistication and verbal ingenuity, White is a poet of the world as we know it, an observer of poignant situations – and a conveyor of them. Whether it’s an anonymous, depressed woman walking her dog (‘'not a small one'’) until its feet bleed and then carrying it ‘'all the way home, wherever that was'’, or a Lebanese couple running a take-away for decades, White over and over again leaves us moved by what she has shown us. As well as by poignancy, however, the book is held together by certain thematic threads. One is a feeling for depression, the strangeness of it, the way it cannot be lifted by a mere effort of will. It is ablankness as wide as the long sea'’ (‘'St Kilda'’) and raises the question ‘'Where does illness live,/what does it want? . . . Describe your fear. How do you feel out of 10?/Out of 9?’’ (‘'Notes for the Time Being'’).\"\n\nAnd of 'Reading for a Quiet Morning':\n\n\"White’s mini-epic poem, 'How the Temple Was Built', which comprises the first half of her collection, reveals an authoritative voice delivering what feels like a Ted Hughes-inspired sermon on a new Ezekiel myth. The lens here, however, is distinctly female, the account feminist.\"\n\"... these poems are lit up and muse-inspired, mini Ezekiels all in the face of baffling Gods.\"\n\n\"Petra White’s fourth poetry collection, Reading for a Quiet Morning, is a narrative-driven, subversive poetic experiment...\" \"Myths and religious script, alongside feminist and secular theory, are shown as one among many ways of interpreting the world, any promises of cosmic revelation always farcically, but no less tragically, limited. But there is resistance and strength within these attempts at sense-making that White subtly celebrates despite her critiques.\"\n\n Poetry \n The Incoming Tide.

        "Jerome Allen Seinfeld ( ; born April 29, 1954) is an American stand-up comedian, actor, writer, and producer. From 1989 to 1998, he played a semi-fictionalized version of himself in the sitcom Seinfeld, which he created and wrote with Larry David. The show aired on NBC from 1989 until 1998, becoming one of the most acclaimed and popular sitcoms of all time. As a stand-up comedian, Seinfeld specializes in observational comedy. In 2004, Comedy Central named him the 12th-greatest stand-up comedian of all time.\n\nSeinfeld co-produced, co-wrote, and starred in the 2007 film Bee Movie, which was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Animated Feature Film. In 2010, he premiered a reality series called The Marriage Ref, which aired for two seasons on NBC. Seinfeld is the creator and host of the web series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee (2012–2019). He is married to author and philanthropist Jessica Seinfeld, with whom he has three children. Seinfeld has received twenty Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his work on Seinfeld and Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee as well as four Grammy Award nominations for his comedy albums.\n\nEarly life and education \nSeinfeld was born in Brooklyn, New York City. His father, Kálmán Seinfeld, a sign painter, was Jewish and collected jokes that he heard while serving in World War II. His mother, Betty (née Hosni) and her parents, Selim and Salha Hosni, were Jews from Aleppo, Syria. Their nationality was stated as Turkish when they immigrated in 1917, as Syria was under the Ottoman Empire. Seinfeld has an older sister, Carolyn. Salha's mother Garez Dayan, Seinfeld's great-grandmother, was a member of the Dayan rabbinic family, who claim ancestry back to the Medieval Exilarchs, and from the Exilarchs back to the Biblical King David. Seinfeld's second cousin is musician and actor Evan Seinfeld. Seinfeld grew up in Massapequa, New York, and attended Massapequa High School on Long Island. At 16, he spent time volunteering in Kibbutz Sa'ar in Israel. He attended the State University of New York at Oswego, and transferred after his second year to Queens College, City University of New York, from which he graduated in 1976 with a degree in communications and theater.\n\nCareer\n\n1976–1987: Rise to prominence \nSeinfeld developed an interest in stand-up comedy after brief stints in college productions. He appeared on open-mic nights at Budd Friedman's Improv Club while attending Queens College. After graduation in 1976, he tried out at an open-mic night at New York City's Catch a Rising Star, which led to an appearance in a Rodney Dangerfield HBO special. In 1980, he had a small recurring role on the sitcom Benson, playing Frankie, a mail-delivery boy who had comedy routines that no one wanted to hear. Seinfeld was abruptly fired from the show due to creative differences. Seinfeld said that he was not told he had been fired until he arrived for a read-through session and found that there was no script for him. In January 1981, he performed stand-up on An Evening at the Improv. In May, Seinfeld made an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, impressing Carson and the audience, leading to frequent appearances on that show and others, including Late Night with David Letterman. On September 5, 1987, his first one-hour special Stand-Up Confidential aired live on HBO.\n\n1988–1998: Seinfeld and stardom \n\nSeinfeld created The Seinfeld Chronicles with Larry David in 1988 for NBC. It was renamed Seinfeld to avoid confusion with the short-lived teen sitcom The Marshall Chronicles. By its third season, Seinfeld had become the most watched sitcom on American television. The final episode aired in 1998, and the show has been a popular syndicated re-run ever since. Along with Seinfeld, the show starred Saturday Night Live alumna Julia Louis-Dreyfus and established actors Michael Richards and Jason Alexander. Alexander played George, a caricature of Larry David. Seinfeld is the only actor to appear in every episode.\n\n1998–2010: Established career \nAfter he ended his sitcom, Seinfeld moved back to New York City and returned to stand-up comedy instead of staying in Los Angeles and furthering his acting career. In 1998, he went on tour and recorded a comedy special, titled I'm Telling You for the Last Time. The process of developing and performing new material at clubs around the world was chronicled in a 2002 documentary, Comedian, which also featured fellow comic Orny Adams and was directed by Christian Charles. Seinfeld has written several books, mostly archives of past routines. In the late 1990s, Apple Computer came up with the advertising slogan \"Think different\" and produced a 60-second commercial to promote the slogan. This commercial showed people who were able to \"think differently,\" such as Albert Einstein, Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and many others. It was later cut short to 30 seconds and altered such that Seinfeld was included at the end, although he had not been in the original cut. This shorter version of the commercial aired only once, during the series finale of Seinfeld. \n\n \nIn 2004, Seinfeld appeared in two commercial webisodes promoting American Express, titled The Adventures of Seinfeld & Superman. In these, Seinfeld appeared with a cartoon rendering of Superman, to whom reference was made in numerous episodes of Seinfeld as Seinfeld's hero, voiced by Patrick Warburton (character David Puddy on Seinfeld). The webisodes were directed by Barry Levinson and aired briefly on television. Seinfeld and \"Superman\" were also interviewed by Matt Lauer in a specially recorded interview for the Today show. On November 18, 2004, Seinfeld appeared at the National Museum of American History to donate the \"puffy shirt\" he wore in the Seinfeld episode of the same name. He also gave a speech when presenting the \"puffy shirt,\" saying humorously that \"This is the most embarrassing moment of my life.\" On May 13, 2006, Seinfeld had a cameo appearance on Saturday Night Live as host Julia Louis-Dreyfus' assassin. Louis-Dreyfus in her opening monolog mentioned the \"Seinfeld curse.\" While talking about how ridiculous the \"curse\" was, a stage light suddenly fell next to her. The camera moved to a catwalk above the stage where Seinfeld was standing, holding a large pair of bolt cutters. He angrily muttered, \"Damn it!\" upset that it did not hit her. Louis-Dreyfus continued to say that she is indeed not cursed.\n\nOn February 25, 2007, Seinfeld appeared at the 79th Academy Awards as the presenter for \"Best Documentary.\" Before announcing the nominations, he did a monologue about the unspoken agreement between movie theater owners and movie patrons. On October 4, 2007, Seinfeld made a guest appearance as himself in the 30 Rock episode \"SeinfeldVision.\" On February 24, 2008, at the 80th Academy Awards, Seinfeld appeared as the voice of his Bee Movie animated character Barry, presenting Best Animated Short Film. Before announcing the nominees, he showed a montage of film clips featuring bees, saying that they were some of his early work (as Barry).\n\nOn June 2, 2008, amidst his spring 2008 tour, Seinfeld performed in his hometown of New York City for a one-night-only show at the Hammerstein Ballroom to benefit Stand Up for a Cure, a charity aiding lung cancer research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. In August 2008, the Associated Press reported that Jerry Seinfeld would be the pitchman for Windows Vista, as part of a $300-million advertising campaign by Microsoft. The ads, which were intended to create interest for Windows in support of the subsequent \"I'm a PC\" advertisements, began airing in mid-September 2008. They were cut from television after three installments; Microsoft opted to continue with the \"I'm a PC\" advertisements and run the Seinfeld ads on the Microsoft website as a series of longer advertisements. In March 2009, it was announced that Seinfeld and the entire cast of Seinfeld would be appearing for a reunion in Larry David's HBO series Curb Your Enthusiasm. The fictional reunion took place in the seventh season's finale and starred most of the original cast, including Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jason Alexander, Michael Richards, in a multiple-episode arc. Seinfeld appeared on an episode of the Starz original series Head Case. As was the case in many of his previous guest appearances on sitcoms, he played himself.\n\nIn Australia, Seinfeld appeared on a series of advertisements for the Greater Building Society, a building society based in New South Wales and southeastern Queensland. His appearance in these ads was highly publicized and considered a coup for the society, being the third time Seinfeld had appeared in a television commercial. The advertisements were filmed in Cedarhurst, Long Island, with the street designed to emulate Beaumont Street in Hamilton, where the Greater's head offices are located. Seinfeld also wrote the scripts for the 15 advertisements that were filmed. The ads largely aired in the Northern New South Wales television market, where the society has most of its branches. Seinfeld was the first guest on Jay Leno's talk show The Jay Leno Show, which premiered on September 14, 2009. Seinfeld was featured on Saturday Night Lives Weekend Update sketch to do the \"Really!?!\" segment with Seth Meyers. He executive produced and regularly appeared as a panelist in The Marriage Ref. On August 30, 2010, Seinfeld made a surprise guest appearance on The Howard Stern Show, ending the feud the two had in the early 1990s.\n\nSeinfeld toured the U.S. in 2011 and made his first stand-up appearance in the United Kingdom in 11 years. In July 2011, he was a surprise guest on The Daily Show, helping Jon Stewart to suppress his urge to tell \"cheap\" \"Michele Bachmann's husband acts gay\" jokes. Seinfeld also launched a personal archives website at JerrySeinfeld.com and appeared in the HBO special Talking Funny with fellow comedians Chris Rock, Louis C.K., and Ricky Gervais in the same year.\n\n2011–present \nComedians in Cars Getting Coffee\n\nIn 2012, Seinfeld started a web series titled Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, in which he would pick up a fellow comedian in a different car each episode and take them out for coffee and conversation. The show originally aired on the Crackle streaming service and then was bought by Netflix. The initial series consisted of ten episodes lasting from 7 to 25 minutes each. The show has continued to get high-profile guests such as Tina Fey, Dave Chappelle, Louis C.K., Eddie Murphy, Steve Martin, David Letterman, Chris Rock, John Mulaney, Mel Brooks, Don Rickles, Ellen DeGeneres, Howard Stern, and Jerry Lewis. The show has also hosted Seinfeld alums Larry David, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Jason Alexander, and Michael Richards. Season seven featured its most high-profile guest, then-President Barack Obama. In a farewell tribute video for the Obamas before the President left office, Seinfeld stated, \"That knocking on the Oval Office window. That probably was the peak of my entire existence.\"\n\nSeinfeld signed a deal with Netflix in January 2017 that included placing Seinfeld and Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee on their streaming service as well as two new Seinfeld stand-up specials and the development of scripted and non-scripted comedy programming. As part of the deal, all episodes of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee were made available on the streaming service, in addition to a new 24-episode season.\n\nIn June 2013, Seinfeld appeared on rapper Wale's album The Gifted, on the song \"Outro About Nothing.\" In 2013, Seinfeld was offered $110 million by television executive Warren Littlefield to make another season of Seinfeld. He turned it down because he felt the timing to continue was not right. Seinfeld received coverage for his speech at the 2014 Clio Awards ceremony, where he received an honorary award, as media reporters said that he \"mocked\" and \"ripped apart\" the advertising industry; his statement that \"I love advertising because I love lying\" received particular attention. \n\nIn 2014, Seinfeld hosted the special Don Rickles: One Night Only at the Apollo Theatre. The event celebrated Don Rickles and his career, but also served as a roast among friends. Those who participated in the event included Jon Stewart, David Letterman, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Nathan Lane, Regis Philbin, Robert De Niro, and Martin Scorsese. On February 15, 2015, Seinfeld made a guest appearance on the Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special, where he hosted the \"Questions from the Audience\" segment, which included cameos from Michael Douglas, John Goodman, James Franco, Larry David, Ellen Cleghorne, Dakota Johnson, Tim Meadows, Bob Odenkirk, and Sarah Palin (who Seinfeld initially mistook for Tina Fey). On May 20, 2015, Seinfeld made a guest appearance on David Letterman's final Late Show episode. Seinfeld joined other friends of the show to pay tribute to Letterman. The other guests included Alec Baldwin, Barbara Walters, Steve Martin, Jim Carrey, Chris Rock, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Peyton Manning, Tina Fey, and Bill Murray who all participated in The Top Ten List segment, \"Things I've Always Wanted to Say to Dave.\" \n\nIn January 2017, Seinfeld went on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and joined Dave Chappelle and Jimmy Fallon in honoring outgoing First Lady Michelle Obama, and played a game of Catchphrase, which Obama and Fallon won to Seinfeld's dismay. On September 19, 2017, Netflix released the stand-up comedy special Jerry Before Seinfeld. It follows Seinfeld as he returns for a stand-up routine at the New York City comedy club, Comic Strip Live, which started his career. It is intercut with documentary clips and his stand-up special. It was later released as an LP, CD and download album, and was nominated for a 2018 Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album.\n\nIn 2020, it was announced that Netflix would be releasing Seinfeld's first original stand-up special in 22 years, 23 Hours to Kill. The special premiered on May 5. In October 2020, Seinfeld joined Steve Martin in a discussion about comedy at The New Yorker Festival. They discussed subjects ranging from the creative process, Netflix, and The Oscars, to their comedy backgrounds, and the future of comedy during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBooks\nSeinfeld wrote the book SeinLanguage, released in 1993. Written as his television show was first rising in popularity, it is primarily an adaptation of his stand-up material. The title comes from an article in Entertainment Weekly listing the numerous catchphrases for which the show was responsible. In 2002, he wrote the children's book Halloween. The book was illustrated by James Bennett. Seinfeld wrote the forewords to Ted L. Nancy's Letters from a Nut series of books and Ed Broth's Stories from a Moron. Seinfeld also wrote the foreword to the Peanut Butter & Co. Cookbook. In October 2020, Seinfeld released his new book Is This Anything?. The book chronicles Seinfeld's 45 years working in comedy and contains many of his best bits that span from various decades.\n\nInfluences\nSeinfeld has stated, \"On the Mount Rushmore of stand-up comedy, there are four faces, in my opinion: Richard Pryor, George Carlin, Bill Cosby, and Don Rickles.\" Seinfeld has also cited as his influences Jean Shepherd, Mad Magazine, Jonathan Winters, Jerry Lewis, Robert Klein, and Abbott and Costello. He stated, \"Monty Python was a gigantic influence on me. They were just about silly, funny things that meant nothing, and that’s the stuff I love. There’s a wonderful childlike freedom in those kinds of things.\"\n\nIn the Netflix comedy special, Jerry Before Seinfeld, he displayed his personal comedy albums collection from when he was a teenager. These albums included:\n\nLenny Bruce – Thank You Masked Man (1972)\nGeorge Carlin – Class Clown (1972)\nSteve Martin – Let's Get Small (1977)\nBob Newhart – The Button-Down Mind of Bob Newhart (1960)\nMike Nichols and Elaine May – Improvisations to Music (1958)\nMel Brooks and Carl Reiner – 2000 and One Years with Carl Reiner and Mel Brooks (1961)\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Seinfeld stated his five favorite films are The Heartbreak Kid (1972), The Graduate (1967), The In-Laws (1979), A Night at the Opera (1935), and Glengarry Glen Ross (1992).\n\nThose influenced by Seinfeld include John Mulaney, Jim Gaffigan, Judd Apatow, Ellen DeGeneres, and Issa Rae.\n\nPersonal life\nSeinfeld is a fan of the New York Mets, and periodically calls Steve Somers' show on WFAN-AM, a sports talk radio station, as \"Jerry from Queens.\" Seinfeld called four innings of a Mets game on SportsNet New York on June 23, 2010, reuniting with analyst Keith Hernandez, who appeared in the Seinfeld two-part episode entitled \"The Boyfriend.\" According to Seinfeld, he thinks about baseball \"all day\" and has said \"when I think of retirement, all I would think of is going to a baseball game every day.\"\n\nSeinfeld is left-handed and the first joke he ever wrote was about the topic. In a 2014 interview with NBC News, he made statements suggesting that he believed he was on the autism spectrum. However, following criticism for his alleged self-diagnosis, he later clarified that he is not autistic and had been commenting on a play about the condition that he \"related to [...] on some level.\"\n\nSeinfeld has made several political contributions, including to George W. Bush's and Al Gore's presidential campaigns in 2000, and subsequently to four Democratic Party primary candidates in 2000 and 2004.\n\nRelationships and marriage \nYears before Seinfeld was created, Seinfeld dated Carol Leifer. She was a fellow comedian, and one of the inspirations for the Seinfeld character Elaine Benes. On national television with sex therapist and talk show host Dr. Ruth Westheimer, he mentioned that he was engaged in 1984 but called it off.\n\nIn May 1993, then 38-year-old Seinfeld met 17-year-old Shoshanna Lonstein in Central Park. After a brief conversation, he got her phone number. Lonstein was still a senior in high school and would turn 18 on May 29, 1993. Seinfeld and Lonstein dated for approximately four years, from 1993 to 1997. She transferred from George Washington University to UCLA, in part to be with him, and cited missing New York City and constant press coverage as reasons for the relationship ending. \n\nThe age difference led to intense media scrutiny. While Seinfeld was a guest on Howard Stern's talk show, Stern said, \"so, you sit in Central Park and have a candy bar on a string and pull it when the girls come?\" at which point Seinfeld replied, \"she's not 17, definitely not.\" A few months later, in his second Howard Stern interview, Seinfeld insisted, \"I didn't realize she was so young. This is the only girl I ever went out with who was that young. I wasn't dating her. We just went to a restaurant, and that was it.\" Early in their relationship, Spy Magazine referred to Lonstein as \"a legal voter\", mocking her young age. \n\nIn an October 1993 Playboy interview, Seinfeld described the reactions to the relationship as ranging \"from horrified to just busting buttons with pride that they know me\", noting that his female acquaintances had overall reacted more negatively than his male ones. He said that his assistant \"was so mad\" she punched him, whereas his mother was \"thrilled\". He concluded, \"if she's 18, if she's intelligent, that's fine\". In March 1994, Seinfeld again defended their age difference in an interview with People, stating that \"Shoshanna is a person, not an age.\" Julia Louis-Dreyfus said in a 1998 New York interview that she was in favor of the relationship, as \"it was a happy one for him\", and added that she did not believe there was anything wrong with it.\n\nIn August 1998, while at a Reebok Sports Club, Seinfeld met Jessica Sklar, a public relations executive for Tommy Hilfiger who had just returned from a three-week honeymoon in Italy with then-husband Eric Nederlander, a theatrical producer and scion of a theater-owning family. Unaware of Sklar's marital status, Seinfeld invited her out. When Sklar eventually told Seinfeld about her relationship situation, she said, \"I told him I didn't think this was the right time for me to be involved with anybody.\" Two months later, Sklar filed for divorce and continued dating Seinfeld. The pair married on December 25, 1999. Comedian George Wallace was the best man at the wedding. After the nuptials, Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld bought Billy Joel's house in Amagansett, Long Island, for US$32 million after news of the couple's interest in the property became public in 2000. The Seinfelds have a daughter and two sons.\n\nReligion \nSeinfeld is Jewish and has incorporated elements of his Jewish identity in his work.\n\nSeinfeld stated that he took a Scientology course when he was in his 20s; he said that he found it interesting but that he did not pursue it any further.\n\nTranscendental Meditation \nIn December 2012, Seinfeld said that he had been practicing Transcendental Meditation (TM) for 40 years. He promoted the use of the technique in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder with Bob Roth of the David Lynch Foundation in December 2012 on Good Morning America, and also appeared at a 2009 David Lynch Foundation benefit for TM, at which Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr appeared. On November 5, 2015, the David Lynch Foundation organized a benefit concert at New York City's Carnegie Hall called \"Change Begins Within\" to promote transcendental meditation for stress control. \"It's been the greatest companion technique of living that I've ever come across, and I'm thrilled to be part of this movement that seems to have really been reinvigorated by Bob [Roth] and David Lynch,\" Seinfeld said. \"I would do anything that I could to promote it in the world, because I think it's the greatest thing as a life tool, as a work tool and just making things make sense.\"\n\nCharity \nIn 1999, Seinfeld auctioned a Breitling Chronomat watch as part of the \"Famous Faces, Watch Auction For Charity\" event in New York City. This watch sold for $11,000.\n\nIn 2001, Jerry and Jessica Seinfeld created the charitable organization The Good+Foundation after their first child was born. Good+Foundation grants donations of products and services to programs that have demonstrated a capacity to address family poverty in three focus areas: supporting new mothers, investing in early childhood, and engaging fathers. GOOD+ Foundation has donated over $42M worth of items through its partner network across the United States.\n\nSeinfeld has also participated in Jon Stewart's charity event, Night of Too Many Stars.\n\nWealth\nAccording to Forbes magazine, Seinfeld's cumulative earnings from Seinfeld as of 2004 was $267 million, placing him at the top of the celebrity earnings list that year. He turned down $5 million per episode, for 22 episodes, to continue the show for a 10th season. Seinfeld earned $100 million from syndication deals and stand-up performances in 2004, and $60 million in 2006. He also earned $10 million for appearing with Bill Gates in Microsoft's 2008 advertisements for Windows. Between June 2008 and June 2009, Seinfeld earned $85 million, making him the world's highest-paid comedian during those 12 months. In 2013, Forbes documented Seinfeld's annual income as $32 million. In mid-2013, Seinfeld disputed Forbes claims regarding his income and net worth on The Howard Stern Show. Seinfeld was ranked by Forbes the highest-paid comedian for 2015, the second-highest-paid in 2016, and the highest-paid again in 2017. Seinfeld's income between June 2016 and June 2017 was $69 million.\n\nAutomobiles\n\nSeinfeld is an automobile enthusiast and collector, and he owns a collection of about 150 cars, including a large Porsche collection. He rented a hangar at the Santa Monica Airport in Santa Monica, California, for an extended period during the 1990s for storage of some of the vehicles in the collection. In 2002, Seinfeld purchased property on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York City where he built a $1.4 million two-story garage to store part of his Porsche collection on the East Coast. One tally has Seinfeld owning 43 Porsches. Paul Bannister has written that Seinfeld's collection includes Porsche 911s from various years, 10 Porsche Boxsters each painted a different color, and the 1955 Porsche 550 Spyder, the same model and pearl-grey color that actor James Dean had been driving before he crashed that car and subsequently died.\n\nThe Discovery Channel television show Chasing Classic Cars claimed that Seinfeld owns the first and last produced air-cooled Porsche 911s. The centerpiece is a $700,000 Porsche 959, one of only 337 built. He was originally not allowed to drive it, because the car was \"not street legal.\" U.S. emissions and crash tests had not been performed for the model because Porsche refused to donate four Porsche 959s for destruction tests. Seinfeld imported the car \"for exhibition purposes,\" on the stipulation that it may never be driven on U.S. roads. The car was made U.S. street legal in 1999 under the \"Show or Display\" federal law. Seinfeld wrote an article for the February 2004 issue of Automobile, reviewing the Porsche Carrera GT.\n\nIn 2008, Seinfeld was involved in a car accident when the brakes on his 1967 Fiat 500 failed and, to avoid an intersection, he pulled the emergency brake while turning sharply, ultimately causing the car to flip onto its side. No one was hurt.\n\nEspresso machines\nA coffee and espresso machine aficionado, Seinfeld owns multiple espresso machines, including the $17,000 Elektra Belle Epoque and two machines manufactured by Slayer and Breville. Seinfeld described his single-group Slayer machine, which costs upwards of $8,500, as a \"beautiful machine.\" When NPR asked him about the influence of coffee culture in the U.S., Seinfeld responded in 2013:I never liked [coffee] and I didn't understand it and I used to do a lot of stuff in my stand-up set in the '80s and '90s about how I don't 'get' coffee. And then something happened about five years ago. I started touring a lot, and we would have these great big, fun breakfasts in the hotel and [coffee] just seemed to go really well [with breakfast]. [Now], I've just started this espresso thing.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nTelevision\n\nStand-up specials\n\nReferences\n\nVideo games\n\nDiscography\n\nDirecting\n\nWritten works \nSeinLanguage (1993)\nHalloween (2002)\nIs This Anything?

        "In continuum mechanics, hydrostatic stress, also known as volumetric stress, is a component of stress which contains uniaxial stresses, but not shear stresses. A specialized case of hydrostatic stress contains isotropic compressive stress, which changes only in volume, but not in shape. Pure hydrostatic stress can be experienced by a point in a fluid such as water. It is often used interchangeably with \"pressure\" and is also known as confining stress, particularly in the field of geomechanics.\n\nHydrostatic stress is equivalent to the average of the uniaxial stresses along three orthogonal axes and can be calculated from the first invariant of the stress tensor:\n\nIts magnitude in a fluid, , can be given by:\n\nwhere \n is an index denoting each distinct layer of material above the point of interest;\n is the density of each layer;\n is the gravitational acceleration (assumed constant here; this can be substituted with any acceleration that is important in defining weight);\n is the height (or thickness) of each given layer of material. \n\nFor example, the magnitude of the hydrostatic stress felt at a point under ten meters of fresh water would be\n\nwhere the index  indicates \"water\".\n\nBecause the hydrostatic stress is isotropic, it acts equally in all directions.

        "Polycarpus Nelson (July 21, 1680 - December 19, 1738) was a landowner and  leading citizen of Colonial New York. He held lands In Dutchess County, where he was involved in the Great Nine Partners Patent.\n\nFamily and Origins \nPolycarpus was born to John and Hendrickje Nelson on Long Island, New York.  His father was one of the original incorporators of Mamaroneck, where he was elected Constable in 1699 and Town Officer in 1702. Polycarpus was married to Ruth Gedney of the Gedney Family and together, they had 18 children.  He came from the same Nelson family in England as Horatio Nelson; However, unlike other branches of the family, the New York Nelsons could not keep an unbroken line. Nelson was an ancestor of New York politician William Nelson.\n\nJohn Nelson, the father of Polycarpus, emigrated from the town of Norfolk between the years 1660 and 1665.  The ship in which he sailed was forced, by the weather, to the coast of France, where the passengers were distributed among the French Peasantry until the ship could be repaired.  John Nelson was given quarters by a French Physician named Polycarpus.  Nelson offered to repay Polycarpus for his kindness, but he refused and requested that Nelson name his firstborn son Polycarpus, which Nelson did.\n\nLife \nNelson was elected constable of Mamaroneck in 1712 and overseer of highways in 1719.  He is listed as the sheriff of Dutchess county at the time of his death in 1738.  The Nelson estate was situated on Nelson hill overlooking Mamaroneck bay.  Nelson Hill, which bore the name of the father of Polycarpus, was made memorable on the day before the Battle of White Plains, when Colonel Smallwood cut off a large British force commanded by Major Robert Rogers stationed on Nelson hill.  33 years after the original Great Nine Partners Patent was issued, Nelson bought 1304 acres of land, lying on Crum-Elbow Creek in the town of Clinton, from three attorneys of David Jamison. The land which Nelson owned is now a part of the Vanderbilt National Historic Site in Hyde Park. Nelson was a signer of the declaration by the country's leading citizens in support of William and Mary and against the house of Stuart.  In 1738 while Polycarpus was constable, he was killed in his tannery at Mamaroneck.  He was sent to arrest one of his own employees; when a man stuck him with a tanner's cleaver, splitting his head and killing him instantly.\n\nReferences \n\n18th-century American landowners",

        "John Elliot (also known as Jack Elliot, John M. Elliot, John M. Elliott and Jack Elliott) (7 May 1914 – 3 January 1972) was an American songwriter, credited with having written more than 600 songs for motion pictures.\n\nBiography\nElliot was born in Gowanda, New York, on 7 May 1914. He was educated at Bennett High School in Buffalo, New York and then worked as an entertainer in vaudeville, nightclubs, and on radio. In 1939, he also worked as a theatre reporter for the Chicago edition of Variety magazine. He began to write songs in 1940, moved to Hollywood in 1943, and became a member of ASCAP in 1945. Jack subsequently composed songs for over 40 Western movies at Republic Studios alone, most notably for Roy Rogers and Dale Evans films.\n\nHe was the lyricist for several songs by Harold Spina, including \"It's So Nice To Have A Man Around The House\" (made famous by Dinah Shore). With Lew Quadling, he wrote \"Sam's Song\", which was a hit recording in 1950 for both Bing Crosby (Decca 27112) and Joe \"Fingers\" Carr (Capitol 962). Elliot also wrote songs with Sonny Burke for Walt Disney's Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom which won the 1953 Oscar for Best Short Animated Feature.\n\nBy 1955, Time magazine was describing him as an \"ex-songwriter and Hollywood producer of TV commercials\" and as the manager of French-born nightclub singer, Vicki Benet. At the time, Elliot and Benet were developing a television series called Rendezvous with Vicki, which was to be hosted by a \"genuine British lord\" who would also do the commercials. In 1964, Elliot and Benet married in Sydney where Elliot was working on a television series with Australian producer and promoter Jack Neary.\n\nElliot died of a heart attack in Los Angeles, California, on 3 January 1972 at the age of 57. He had married Judy Rotman in 1940: they had a son John Michael.\n\nNotes and references\n\nSources\nAmerican Film Institute, The American Film Institute catalog of motion pictures produced in the United States, Volume 1, Part 1, University of California Press, 1971. \nCotter, Bill, The Wonderful World of Disney Television: A Complete History, Hyperion, 1997.  \nJasen, David A., A century of American popular music: 2000 best-loved and remembered songs (1899–1999), Taylor & Francis, 2002.  \nLonergan, David F., Hit records, 1950-1975, Scarecrow Press, 2005. \nMcNamara, Daniel I.

        "Cabralism is the period from 1842 to 1846 when António Bernardo da Costa Cabral dominated Portuguese politics. Cabralism was characterized by the adoption of the constitutional doctrine contained in the restored Constitutional Charter of 1826, which was taken as a dogma to be scrupulously respected, thus creating a stable framework that was exploited by the government. The government was characterized by being a strong executive, decisively supported by the royal powers enshrined in the Charter, especially the reserve power vested in the sovereign.\n\nHistory\n\nWith the express support of Queen Maria II, of whom Costa Cabral was considered a valedictorian, the government's parliamentary front was secured by an obedient majority, congregated in an exclusivist party and committed to maintaining, against the onslaughts of the left and the remnants of Miguelism, the order deemed necessary for the country's development.\n\nOne of the first reforms of Cabralism was administrative centralization, approving the Administrative Code of 1842. This was followed by the reform of Portugal's National Guards, one of the previous factors of instability, the resumption of relations with the Holy See and the control of foreign debt and the government deficit.\n\nCabralism attempted to launch an ambitious public works program, creating public-private partnerships with the creation of state creditor companies. On the social front, it legislated on public education and health, trying to modernize these sectors.\n\nHaving to take out a loan of 2400 escudos, an astronomical sum at the time, he was forced into a tax reform aimed at increasing state revenue, which began a rapid process of erosion of the popular support base for the government.\n\nIn a clear show of favor, Queen Maria II appointed Costa Cabral an effective Councillor of State (1843), a Peer of the Realm (1844) and elevated him to Count of Tomar (1845), for two lives. However, the rapid enrichment of Costa Cabral, who, from the position of a modest lawyer, in a few years became the holder of a considerable fortune, which included a palace capable of hosting the Queen, as well as the nepotism of which he was accused, since his brother José Bernardo da Silva Cabral, also made 1st Count of Tomar, was also accused of nepotism. Silva Cabral, who also became the 1st Count of Cabral, was one of the government's supporters (hence the name government of the Cabral), making Costa Cabral a figure hated by vast swathes of the population. When his other brother and his father also entered parliament, accusations of nepotism, clientelism and concussion in public tenders grew.\n\nWhen, in January 1846, the unstoppable increase in public spending and the consequent state deficit led to the state's credit being cut off, making bankruptcy imminent, Cabralism fell into agony. Thus, despite having completed the legislature, and having been the first government of Portuguese liberalism to achieve this feat, popular discontent was such that the slightest agitation threatened to result in an uprising. This is what happened in the spring of 1846 with the Maria da Fonte Revolution.\n\nThe end of Cabralism\nFaced with the spread of the popular uprising, the Queen was forced to dismiss Costa Cabral, who went into exile to Madrid. That was the end of Cabralism.\n\nDespite all its shortcomings and corruption, in the end Cabralism was a necessary stage in Portuguese liberalism. Costa Cabral consolidated the liberal state, based on strong centralization and a complex bureaucracy. Based on the army, freemasonry, of which Costa Cabral was Grand Master of the Lusitanian Grand Orient, and clientele who benefited from the economic and financial policy, based on public works and development, Cabralism laid the foundations of the current Portuguese state, and many of its features have survived to the present day.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\nBonifácio, Maria de Fátima, História da Guerra Civil da Patuleia 1846-1847, Editorial Estampa, Lisboa, 1993 (ISBN 9723309270)\nCapela, José Viriato; Borralheiro, Rogério, A Revolução do Minho de 1846 e as reformas da administração.

        "The Health Care Consent Act (HCCA) is an Ontario law concerned with the capacity to consent to treatment and admission to care facilities. (i.e., informed consent).  on a date to be named by proclamation of the Lieutenant Governor, the act will apply to confining in a care facility.\n\nThe HCCA states that a person has the right to consent to or refuse treatment if they have mental capacity. In order to have capacity, a person must have the \"ability\" to understand and appreciate the consequences of the treatment decision. The law says that “a person is capable with respect to a treatment, admission to a care facility or a personal assistance service if the person is able to understand the information that is relevant to making a decision about the treatment, admission or personal assistance service, as the case may be, and able to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a decision or lack of decision”.\n\nRelationship to other Acts\n\nThe HCCA exists in addition to the Ontario Mental Health Act (MHA) because, while the MHA governs detention in a psychiatric facility, the HCCA governs whether or not a person can be treated while in hospital (for example, with anti-psychotic medication that can reduce symptoms of serious mental illness such as schizophrenia).\n\nThe Ontario HCCA is also relevant to the Substitute Decisions Act. A person may be found to lack capacity for personal care and need a substitute decision maker (SDM) to decide whether to consent to or refuse treatment with psychiatric medication. The law says that “a person is incapable of personal care if the person is not able to understand information that is relevant to making a decision concerning his or her own health care, nutrition, shelter, clothing, hygiene or safety, or is not able to appreciate the reasonably foreseeable consequences of a decision or lack of decision.”\n\nHCCA and the Right to Refuse Treatment\n\nThere is a widely reported Supreme Court of Canada case called Starson v. Swayze that dealt with the right of a mentally ill person to refuse treatment, even if it is in their best interests to be treated (for example, with anti-psychotic medication that would reduce delusional thinking).\n\nThe majority in Starson v. Swayze ultimately decided that Starson did not lack capacity so he could make his own treatment decisions, even if his decision (to refuse anti-psychotic medication that would reduce delusional thinking) was not in his best interests. As a result, he could not be treated with psychiatric medication, even if that meant that his health deteriorated as a result.\n\nCritics of the decision in Starson argue that, because of mental deterioration, Starson did not have the capacity to make the decision to refuse treatment, and that his right to autonomy needs to be balanced with the right to be well. See also: autonomy as opposed to paternalism or beneficence. Autonomy is a complex concept in bioethics that has many variations. For example, there is the concept of supported autonomy, that is, in order to support the autonomy of the person in the long term it may be necessary to compromise autonomy in the short term.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Ontario Health Care Consent Act \n Ontario Mental Health Act \n Substitute Decisions Act \n Starson v.

        "Woo Ji-won (born 2 April 1973) is a South Korean retired professional basketball player. He played for three different teams over a fourteen-year career, the longest of which was spent at Ulsan Hyundai Mobis Phoebus, who retired his number 10 shirt after his retirement. He was nicknamed \"Prince of the Court\" (코트의 황태자).\n\nEarly life\nWoo enjoyed playing baseball and ran track as a child. He started playing basketball when his elementary school started a basketball team and recruited him to join, despite his short stature for his age. From there, he began focusing on basketball and attended Samseon Middle School and Kyungbock High School in Seoul, both known for their basketball teams. He graduated with a degree in law from Yonsei University, unusual for college athletes as the majority studied sports science, physical education or a related major. One of his middle school and high school classmates was future national teammate and best friend Chun Hee-chul.\n\nPlaying career\n\nCollege career\nWoo's time at Yonsei University coincided with what is often retrospectively dubbed the \"golden era\" of domestic college basketball. He and his teammates, as well as their counterparts from traditional athletic rivals Korea University, enjoyed a level of popularity similar to that of idol singers and A-list actors/actresses due to their skills and good looks. Together with his Yonsei teammates Lee Sang-min and Moon Kyung-eun and Korea University's Hyun Joo-yup and Chun Hee-chul, among others, they were collectively dubbed \"Oppa Troupe\" (오빠부대) by the media. Woo and his Yonsei teammates drew significant attention after they defeated a Busan Kia team which boasted the senior amateur league's most formidable offensive players, the \"Hur-Dong-Taek Trio\" (Hur Jae, Kang Dong-hee and Kim Yoo-taek) during the 1993-94 season.\n\nProfessional career\nIn 1996, Woo was signed by the Incheon-based team of Daewoo Securities, which has since become Daegu KOGAS Pegasus, and is among the last generation of players who began their senior careers during the semi-professional pre-KBL era. He took the National Basketball Festival, then the main basketball competition, by storm on his debut for Daewoo, scoring 24 points in a 78-71 win against Tongyang. In 1998, he and Chun enlisted for mandatory military service and were assigned as public service workers, rather than the Sangmu basketball team. They were discharged ahead of the 1999-2000 season. After five seasons with the Incheon team and no silverware, he signed with Seoul Samsung Thunders.\n\nWoo was signed by Ulsan Hyundai Automons (later renamed Ulsan Hyundai Mobis Phoebus) in 2002. During the 2003-04 season, Woo set the record for the most points scored in a single game in the Korean Basketball League, scoring 70 points against Changwon LG Sakers in March. On the same day Moon Kyung-eun scored 66 points (22 three-pointers) against TG Sambo, ranking second behind Woo. The records came under scrutiny from fans and the media due to the statistical impossibility of such records occurring during a regular professional game unless collusion between players and coaches had taken place and the opposing team intentionally failing to play in a usual competitive manner to allow the respective players to achieve their records. As no evidence was ever presented to support the theory, the records still remain in the KBL's record book, but have been described as \"shameful\" and \"embarrassing\" by the media and still regarded as a taboo topic by head coaches and players of the respective teams from the two games. In later years, Moon and Woo have declined to mention the records whenever their career achievements are brought up. After the 2003-04 season, the KBL stopped issuing an award to the top scorer at its annual awards ceremony and only releases the statistics on its official website.\n\nWoo retired at the end of the 2009-10 season. His retirement coincided with that of Lee Sang-min and Moon Kyung-eun, leading the media to dub it the \"end of an era\". All three players had their jersey numbers retired by their respective clubs. Woo's number 10 jersey was retired by Ulsan Hyundai Mobis Phoebus.\n\nNational team\nWoo was part of the team which won the 1997 ABC Championship. He and Chun Hee-chul were supposed to participate in the 1998 Asian Games but the Korean Basketball Association's request was turned down by the government agency overseeing their public service term.\n\nPost-retirement\nAfter retiring, Woo became a commentator for SBS Sports. He has also appeared on various variety programs, mostly with fellow retired basketball players such as Seo Jang-hoon and Hur Jae.\n\nFilmography\n\nTelevision show\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nReferences\n\n1973 births\nLiving people\nSouth Korean men's basketball players\nSouth Korean basketball commentators\nBasketball announcers\nDaegu KOGAS Pegasus players\nUlsan Hyundai Mobis Phoebus players\nSeoul Samsung Thunders players\nKorean Basketball League players with retired numbers\nKyungbock High School alumni\nYonsei University alumni\nDanyang Woo clan",

Talwar starring Meena Kumari, Kishore Kumar and Shammi Kapoor.\n\nPlot \nBombay-based Meena lives a wealthy lifestyle along with her Chacha and Chachi in a mansion. When asked to marry, she places an advertisement in the local newspaper, and after interviewing many males, chooses Manohar to be her future husband. She shares this news as well as introduces him to her family - who disapprove and remind her that her late father had selected a groom named Sunder even before she was born. She scoffs at this and announces that she will marry Manohar soon. Then Sunder, who was living at an ashram for Brahmacharis, shows up at her home - complete in  traditional ashram clothing and is ready to marry her. When facing rejection, he decides to change his lifestyle and be like Manohar - and does so - albeit with hilarious results. He is pleased when he notices a change in her and takes her home to introduce her to his mother - little knowing that the change is only superficial - and she an hidden agenda.\n\nCast \nMeena Kumari as Meena\nKishore Kumar as Sunder\nShammi Kapoor as Manohar\nKumkum as Kamini\nMehmood as Hardeep Kumar\nOm Prakash as Brothel Patron\nRandhir as Communist\nShivraj as Sunder's Guru\nPratima Devi as Sunder's Mother\n\nMusic \nMadan Mohan was the music director while lyricist Rajinder Krishan wrote songs of this film.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nFilms scored by Madan Mohan\n1950s Hindi-language films\nIndian drama films\n1956 drama films\nIndian black-and-white films",

        "BFC Dynamo developed a very successful youth academy during the 1970s. The team had an average age of only 22.7 years before the 1978–79 season. Young talented players in the team were Hans-Jürgen Riediger, Lutz Eigendorf, Norbert Trieloff, Michael Noack, Roland Jüngling, Rainer Troppa, Bodo Rudwaleit, Ralf Sträßer, Hartmut Pelka and Arthur Ullrich. The veterans in the team were Reinhard Lauck, Frank Terletzki, Wolf-Rüdiger Netz and Bernd Brillat. The young team was coached by 31-year-old coach Jürgen Bogs.\n\nBFC Dynamo got off to a strong start in the 1978-79 DDR-Oberliga and won the first ten matches. Lutz Eigendorf defected to West Germany during a friendly match in Kaiserslautern on 20 March 1979. His defection was considered a slap in the face to the East German regime. BFC Dynamo finally won its first DDR-Oberliga title after defeating rival SG Dynamo Dresden 3–1 on the 24th matchday in front of 22,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark. The team set a number of records during the league season.\n\nBFC Dynamo made its debut in the European Cup in the 1979–80 season. The team made it all the way to the quarter-finals of the 1979-80 European Cup, where it faced Nottingham Forest under Brian Clough. BFC Dynamo won the first leg away 1–0. BFC Dynamo thus became the first German team to defeat an English team in England in the European Cup. The success in the league continued, but the competition was fierce. BFC Dynamo won the 1979-80 DDR-Oberliga by defeating first-placed SG Dynamo Dresden on the final matchday and the 1980-81 DDR-Oberliga by defeating second-placed FC Carl Zeiss Jena in the final matchday. BFC Dynamo continued to integrate young players from the youth department into the first team, such as Rainer Ernst in 1979, Bernd Schulz in 1979, Olaf Seier in 1979, Frank Rohde in 1980, Falko Götz in 1980 and Christian Backs in 1981.\n\nBFC Dynamo reached the quarter-finals of the 1981-82 European Cup but was eventually eliminated by Aston Villa. BFC Dynamo now began a period of dominance in the league. The team secured its fourth consecutive league title at the end of the 1981-82 DDR-Oberliga and would go through the entire 1982-83 DDR-Oberliga undefeated.

FC Lokomotive Leipzig.\n\nBFC Dynamo had the best material conditions in the league and was the best team by far. But controversial refereeing decisions in favor of BFC Dynamo gave rise to speculation that the team's dominance was also due to help from referees. Complaints of alleged referee bias accumulated as the team came to dominate the DDR-Oberliga. The German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) conducted a secret review of the 1984–85 season. Among other things, the review showed that BFC Dynamo received significantly fewer yellow cards than rivals SG Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig. A review was also carried out of the final of the 1984-85 FDGB-Pokal. This review showed that the referees had committed several errors in the final to the disadvantage of SG Dynamo Dresden. However, there is no evidence to show that referees were under direct instructions from the Stasi and no document has ever been found in the archives that gave the Stasi a mandate to bribe referees. Former referee Bernd Heynemann concluded: \"The BFC is not ten times champions because the referees only whistled for Dynamo. They were already strong as a bear.\"\n\nThe team was joined by Thomas Doll from relegated F.C. Hansa Rostock for the 1986–87 season.

Eigendorf was one of the most promising players in East German football. He was a product of the elite Children and Youth Sports School (KJS) \"Werner Seelenbinder\" in Hohenschönhausen and had come through the youth academy of BFC Dynamo. He was often called \"The Beckenbauer of East Germany\" and was considered the figurehead and great hope of East German football. Eigendorf was popularly nicknamed \"Iron Foot\" () by the supporters of BFC Dynamo and was said to be one of the favorite players of Erich Mielke. His defection was a slap in the face of the East German regime and was allegedly taken personally by Mielke. Owing to his talent and careful upbringing at BFC Dynamo, his defection was considered a personal defeat of Mielke.\nHis name would later disappear from all statistics and annals about East German football. All fan merchandise with the name or image of Eigendorf would also be removed from the market.

Hans-Jürgen Riedier scored the only goal for BFC Dynamo in the match. The match was attended by 22,000 spectators. 15,500 seats had been reserved for mainly Stasi employees and members SV Dynamo.

The team was then set to play the return leg away against FK Partizan Belgrade on 2 November 1983. The trip to Belgrade would prove dramatic for the team.\n\nDefection and the debut of Andreas Thom (1983)\nThe players in BFC Dynamo received political training and were kept under strict discipline, demanding both political reliability, obedience and a moral lifestyle. No contact with the West was allowed. The players were also under the supervision of the Stasi. They would have their telephones tapped, their rooms at training camps tapped and be accompanied by Stasi employees on international trips. The Ministry of the Interior and the Stasi both had employees integrated into the club. It is also likely that individual players in the club had been recruited as so-called Unofficial collaborators (IM), with the task of collecting information about other players. BFC Dynamo flew to Belgrade with Erich Mielke's service aeroplane on 1 November 1983 for the return leg against FK Partizan Belgrade. Coach Jürgen Bogs allowed the players to go on a shopping tour in Belgrade the morning before the match. During their tour in the city, players Falko Götz and Dirk Schlegel defected to West Germany. The duo had jumped into a taxi and fled to the West German embassy. The ambassador decided to take them to the West German Consulate general in Zagreb. With the help of the West German Consulate general in Zagreb, they obtained fake passports and managed to reach Munich. The East German state news agency ADN reported that Götz and Schlegel had been \"woed by West German managers with large sums of money\" and \"betrayed their team\". Götz and Schlegel were labeled as \"sports traitors\". But their defection had no serious consequences for the team. According to Christian Backs, the team only received more political training, but there were no reprisals. However, the loss of two regular players ahead of the match against FK Partizan Belgrade was a challenge. Coach Bogs then decided to give Andreas Thom the chance to make his international debut as a replacement for Falko Götz. Thom had made his first appearance with the first team of BFC Dynamo only five days earlier and had only played five minutes in the DDR-Oberliga. Thom would make a terrific international debut. BFC Dynamo lost the match 1-0 but advanced to the quarter-finals on goal difference.

The team was now five points ahead of second-placed SG Dynamo Dresden with one match more played, eight points ahead of third-placed FC Carl Zeiss Jena with three matches more played and eight points ahead of fourth-placed 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig with two matches more played. BFC Dynamo played 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig was away on the 18th matchday on 22 March 1986. 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig led the match 1-0 after 90 minutes played. Referee Bernd Stumpf then awarded BFC Dynamo a penalty in the 94th minute, after a foul by Hans Richter on Bernd Schulz. Frank Pastor converted the penalty and set the final score to 1-1. The result meant that 1. FC Lokomotive would no longer have a realistic chance of catching up with BFC Dynamo in the league. BFC Dynamo was also able to extend its lead over SG Dynamo Dresden, as SG Dynamo Dresden had lost 3–1 away against FC Karl-Marx-Stadt on the 18th matchday. The penalty was highly controversial and caused a wave of protests in East German football. However, it would many years later be shown that the penalty was correctly awarded. BFC Dynamo then met SG Dynamo Dresden on the 19th matchday on 29 March 1986. The team took revenge for the loss during the autumn and defeated SG Dynamo Dresden 5–2 in front of 18,000 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark. Striker Peter Kaehlitz scored two goals for BFC Dynamo in the match.\n\nBFC Dynamo reached the semifinals of the 1985-86 FDGB-Pokal. The team was drawn against 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig. BFC Dynamo won the first leg 4–2 at home on 29 April 1986. Uwe Zötzsche scored both goals for 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig on penalties. BFC Dynamo then met FC Karl-Marx-Stadt on the 20th matchday on 5 April 1986. The team lost the match 2–1. The loss against FC Karl-Marx-Stadt was the beginning of a series of weak results in the league. The return leg against 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig was played at Bruno-Plache-Stadion on 6 May 1986. Uwe Zötzsche scored another goal on penalty for 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in the return leg. BFC Dynamo lost the match 3-1 and was eliminated on the away goal rule. 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig had scored a total of three goals on penalties against BFC Dynamo in the semi-finals. BFC Dynamo played a number of draws in the following league matches. The team was only three points ahead of second-placed 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and four points ahead of third-placed FC Carl Zeiss Jena after the 24th matchday. The team then met FC Carl Zeiss Jena at the Ernst-Abbe-Sportfeld on the 25th matchday on 14 May 1986. BFC Dynamo lost the match 3–1. The team was now only two points ahead of second-placed FC Carl Zeiss Jena and third-placed 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig before the final matchday. FC Carl Zeiss Jena also had a better goal difference. BFC Dynamo eventually won the league title after a 4–0 victory over bottom team BSG Stahl Riesa at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 24 May 1986. Michael Schulz scored two goals in the match. It was the club's eighth consecutive league title. The team ended up just two points ahead of second-placed 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig. The former long-term team captain Frank Terletzki retired after the season. Olof Hirsch left for 1. FC Union Berlin and Artur Ullrich for F.C. Hansa Rostock. Terletzki had made his first appearance with the first team of BFC Dynamo in 1969 and had played 17 seasons for the team. In total, Terletzki had played in 489 matches for BFC Dynamo.\n\nControversy, complaints and sanctions (1985–1986)\nBFC Dynamo had the best material conditions in the league and was the best team by far. But there had been controversial refereeing decisions in favor of BFC Dynamo, which gave rise to speculations that the dominance of BFC Dynamo was not solely due to athletic performance, but also due to help from referees.\n\nAllegations of referee bias were nothing new in East German football and were not isolated to matches involving BFC Dynamo. Alleged referee bias as a source of unrest was a thread that ran from the very first matches of the DDR-Oberliga. Alleged referee bias had caused riots already during the first season, when ZSG Horch Zwickau defeated SG Dresden-Friedrichstadt 5–1 on 16 April 1950, in a match which decided the title in the 1949–50 DDR-Oberliga. Another example occurred in the 1960 DDR-Oberliga when ASK Vorwärts Berlin defeated SC Chemie Halle away on 16 October 1960. The player bus of ASK Vorwärts Berlin was attacked and the Volkspolizei had to protect the players. The home ground of Union Berlin was closed for two matchdays as a result of crowd trouble over the performance of referee Günther Habermann in the match between Union Berlin and FC Vorwärts Frankfurt in the 1982-83 DDR-Oberliga on 25 September 1982. The police had been forced to come to the rescue of referee Habermann. German sports historian Hanns Leske claims that referees throughout the history of East German football had a preference for the teams sponsored by the armed organs ().\n\nBFC Dynamo was deeply unpopular in Dresden since the relocation of SG Dynamo Dresden in 1954. Its unparalleled run of success would then arouse envy and hatred among supporters of opposing teams around the country. However, the sense that BFC Dynamo benefited from the soft refereeing decision did not arise first in 1978. It had already existed for years, as shown by the riots among supporters of SG Dynamo Schwerin during the match between the two teams at the Sportplatz Paulshöhe in Schwerin in the 1967-68 DDR-Liga on 26 May 1968.\n\nBFC Dynamo was a representative of both the Stasi and the capital. The club was therefore viewed with more suspicion than affection. Lack of success had kept disapproval in check, but complaints increased and feelings became inflamed as the club grew successful. A turning point eventually came in the fractious encounter between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden at the Dynamo-Stadion in Dresden on 2 December 1978. The match was marked by crowd trouble, with 35 to 38 fans of both teams arrested. The match ended in a 1–1 draw after an equalizer by BFC Dynamo. Then SED First Secretary in Bezirk Dresden Hans Modrow blamed the unrest on \"inept officiating\". Inexperienced linesman Günter Supp should allegedly have missed an offside position on Hans-Jürgen Riediger in the situation leading up to the equalizer. Supporters of SG Dynamo Dresden complained: \"We are cheated everywhere, even on the sports field\".\n\nThe privileges of BFC Dynamo and its overbearing success in the 1980s made fans of opposing teams easily aroused as to what they saw as manipulation by bent referees, especially in Saxon cities such as Dresden and Leipzig. Petitions to authorities were written by citizens, fans of other teams and local members of the SED, claiming referee bias and outright match-fixing in favor of BFC Dynamo. Animosity towards the club had been growing since its first league titles. Frank Rohde said in an interview with German newspaper Die Welt in 2016: \"We had the most titles and the best players. We were the hunted ... We came from the capital, where there was more than anywhere else. Like oranges or bananas. There was resentment against Dynamo and the Stasi – and envy for the success we had.\" The team was met at away matches with aggression and shouts such as \"Bent champions!\" (), \"Stasi-pigs!\" and \"Zyklon B for BFC!\". Fans of BFC Dynamo were taunted by fans of opposing teams with antisemitic slurs such as \"Jewish pigs!\" and \"Berlin Jews!\". Coach Jürgen Bogs would later claim that the hatred from opposing fans actually made the team even stronger.\n\nComplaints of alleged referee bias grew in numbers. The number of petitions reached hundreds in 1985 and 1986. The constant rioting at the guest performances of BFC Dynamo around the country was annoying in the SED Politburo. Canadian professor and author Alan McDugall writes that: \"No other collective cause in the 1980s was as public, popular, united, or effective as the anti-BFC campaign.\" East German authorities were not insensitive to the problems caused by the successes of BFC Dynamo. High-ranking officials such as the Head of the Department for Sport of the SED Central Committee Rudolf Hellmann sometimes answered petitions in person. A petition written to Egon Krenz in March 1986 was even answered by Hellman with a personal meeting. Backed by the ruling SED, the German Football Association of the GDR (DFV) would attempt to mollify anti-BFC sentiments. By the mid-1980s, the scandal surrounding alleged referee bias in East German football had so undermined the credibility of the national competitions that Krenz, Hellman and the DFV Secretariat under DFV General secretary Karl Zimmermann would eventually go ahead with sanctions against referees for poor performance and a restructuring of the DFV Referee Commission.\n\nThe German Gymnastics and Sports Federation (DTSB), SV Dynamo and ASV Vorwärts fought for supremacy in East German sports. The hegemony and dominance of SV Dynamo in all areas of sport had become more and more of a problem for the leading DTSB. The President of the DTSB Manfred Ewald complained that SV Dynamo \"could no longer be controlled\". During the 1983-84 season, Ewald would even make an unsuccessful attempt to liquidate SV Dynamo, which would include a downgrading of all its sports clubs to simple sports communities without any special status and a disempowerment of incumbent functionaries. A power struggle was raging between the DTSB President Manfred Ewald and the President of SV Dynamo Erich Mielke. German autor Steffen Karas suggests that this power struggle can explain the radical upheaval at the DFV in February 1983.\n\nSED top-functionary Karl Zimmermann from Leipzig was established as the new vice-president of the DTSB on 2 February 1983. Two days later, the DTSB President Manfred Ewald and the Head of the Department for Sport of the SED Central Committee Rudolf Hellmann convened an extraordinary meeting of the DFV presidium. The previous DFV leadership (Werner Lempert, Günter Schneider, Konrad Dorner, Hans Müller) would be relieved by the highest authority and the chairmanship of the DFV handed over to the newly appointed DTSB Vice President Zimmermann. Zimmermann thus became the new general secretary of the DFV. As he was also vice president of the DTSB, he would enjoy increased powers compared to his predecessor Werner Lempert. German sports historian Hanns Leske claims that Zimmermann had been chosen to carry out reforms in East German football. German author Steffen Karas in turn suggest that the timing and approach to the establishment of Zimmermann suggests a connection with the plans of the DTSB President Ewald. Karas writes that it can be assumed that the growing anti-BFC sentiments in the stadiums also did not go unnoticed by the SED Politburo, which now expected the DTSB and DFV to take countermeasures.\n\nThe DFV under Zimmermann conducted an internal analysis of the performance and behavior of the referees in the matches involving BFC Dynamo, SG Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig during the 1984-85 season. The report listed nine league and cup matches where BFC Dynamo was allegedly favored. It also claimed that SG Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig had been disadvantaged in eight matches together. According to the analysis, BFC Dynamo had won at least eight points due to refereeing errors in the 26 matches of the league season. The report spoke of \"targeted influence from other authorities\". The report suggested that one leading referee had been given a holiday home at the expense of BFC Dynamo and that journalists had been threatened by anonymous secret police representatives.\n\n The report noted how yellow cards had been used during the season. The report pointed out a discrepancy in yellow cards between BFC Dynamo, SG Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Lokomotiv Lipzig. 45 yellow cards had been handed out to SG Dynamo Dresden and 36 to 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig, compared to 16 yellow cards for BFC Dynamo. The report also listed a number of cases were players in opposing teams had received their third or sixth yellow cards in matches prior to the meeting with BFC Dynamo and thus were suspended from the upcoming match against BFC Dynamo.\n The report also listed instances where offside goals had been awarded to BFC Dynamo and where penalties and correct goals had been denied to the opposing team. According to Hanns Leske, a particularly drastic example during the season occurred in the 1–1 draw between BSG Wismut Aue and BFC Dynamo on the 16th matchday on 2 March 1985. Leske claims that BSG Wismut Aue had scored a winning goal that was disallowed for being offside and that the refereeing decision was so obviously wrong that the scene could not be shown at the Sport Aktuell (de) cast on East German television.\n\nThe report named six referees that were suspected of having favored BFC Dynamo, including Adolf Prokop, Klaus-Dieter Stenzel and Reinhard Purz. It also named a number of referees that were suspected of having disadvantaged SG Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig, including Klaus-Dieter Stenzel, Wolfgang Henning and Klaus Scheurell.\n\nIn the report, the DFV concluded that there had been systematic favoritism towards BFC Dynamo during the 1984-85 season. Zimmermann stated that the hatred of BFC Dynamo was \"growing more and more\" and that the team's performance was discredited and that the \"competition has given up and is no longer even fighting for the championship\". The report spoke of \"the great damage\" that referee bias did to the reputation of BFC Dynamo. Zimmermann called for a suspension of referee Prokop for two international matches and recommended that several referees, including Prokop, Stenzel and Gehard Demme, should no longer be used in matches involving BFC Dynamo, SG Dynamo Dresden and 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig. Zimmermann's report ended up with Egon Krenz, who was a member of the SED Politbüro and the Secretary for Security, Youth and Sport in the SED Central Committee.\n\nThe performance of the officials in the final of the 1984–85 FDGB-Pokal between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden on 8 June 1985 sparked great controversy. The DFV and the East German football weekly Die neue Fußballwoche (FuWo) received more than 700 complaints regarding the performance of the referees in the final. Complaints were also sent in considerable numbers to the Department for Sport of the SED Central Committee and to state-television. The performance of the officials in the final resulted in arguments at the top levels of the SED and the East German regime. Politburo member and the chairman of the Free German Trade Union Federation (FDGB) Harry Tisch was so upset about the performance of referee Manfred Roßner in the final that he protested to Erich Mielke and complained that such performance undermined the credibility of the competition. DFV functionaries, as well as Egon Krenz and other SED politicians, became increasingly uneasy about the negative reactions.\n\nThe report on the 1984–85 season had already outlined a number of measures to clean up the game. Now,the SED demanded further action. The DFV conducted a video review of the performances of the officials in the final. The analysis concluded that referee Roßner and his two assistants had committed an above-average number of errors during the final. A clear majority of the errors had favored BFC Dynamo. The DFV sanctioned referee Roßner with a ban on matches above the second tier as well as international matches for the coming season. Assistant Klaus Scheurell was in turn de-selected from the first round of the next European cup. Now, Zimmermann also spoke out against the head of the DFV Referee Commission Heinz Einbeck, who was a native of Berlin and a sponsoring member of BFC Dynamo. Hanns Leske writes that the DFV Referee Commission had been dominated by BFC Dynamo and claims that the commission had engaged in \"targeted appointment\" of always the same \"proven referees\" for \"desired game management\".\n\nHowever, nothing emerged that indicated that referee Roßner had been bought by the Stasi. On the contrary, Roßner claims that he was approached by the DFV Deputy General Secretary Volker Nickchen before the match, who confidentially requested \"no BFC-friendly decisions\". He was also approached by the incensed DFV Vice President Franz Rydz after the match, who took him to office for his performance with the words: \"You can't always go by the book, but have to officiate in a way that placates the Dresden public\".\n\nOther officials would also be sanctioned by the DFV in the following months. Referee Reinhard Purz and linesman Günter Supp were questioned for their performances during the controversial match between BFC Dynamo and FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt on the ninth matchday of the 1985-86 DDR-Oberliga on 26 October 1985. BFC Dynamo won the match 2–3. Local and regional SED newspapers remarkably often took a stand against the BFC Dynamo-friendly decisions during the 1984-85 season. The journalist Gerhard Weigel wrote in the local newspaper Das Volk that Purz had made \"two match-changing mistakes\". According to Weigel, Purz allegedly gave BFC Dynamo an irregular goal and denied FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt a clear penalty. Even BFC Dynamo Coach Jürgen Bogs said after the match that his team did not need such \"nature protection\". The DFV sanctioned Purz with a ban for the rest of 1985 and Supp with a ban for three match days.\n\nBFC Dynamo President Manfred Kirste sent angry letters to media outlets after the match about reporters he thought fomented anti-BFC sentiments and accused television commentators of failing to correct the \"varied eyesight\" of the spectators in Erfurt. He also complained: \"In the previous weeks, we were rightly criticized for the poor fitness level in our team. Now, when the performances have improved, when the team is playing well and fighting... allegedly 'dubious decisions' by the refereeing collective are being sought out and pushed to the fore!\" In a meeting with DFV leadership on 30 October 1985, journalists expressed indignation at Kirstes attempt to influence the press.\n\n The general disillusionment about BFC Dynamo stood at its peak during the 1985–86 season. The DFV was under intense pressure to take action against referees that allegedly favored BFC Dynamo, notably from the Department for Sport of the SED Central Committee under Rudolf Hellmann. One of the most controversial situations occurred during the match between 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and BFC Dynamo in the 1985-86 DDR-Oberliga on 22 March 1986. 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig led the match 1-0 into extra time when BFC Dynamo was awarded a penalty by referee Bernd Stumpf in the 94th minute. Frank Pastor converted the penalty and equalized. The match ended in a 1–1 draw. The episode, which was later known as \"The shameful penalty of Leipzig\", caused a wave of protests. SED Second Secretary in Bezirk Leipzig Helmut Hackenberg warned the Department for Party Organs of the SED Central Committee that \"corrupt referees\" were bringing East Germany, the DFV and the clubs of the security organs into disrepute. A report in Junge Welt demanded referees who \"do not provide doubtful justice which does harm to our champion team BFC, its reputation acquired by continuous high performance, indeed to each and every player in this team\".\n\nSED General Secretary Erich Honecker and Egon Krenz were fed up with the \"football question\" and the \"BFC-discussion\". Protests flowed into Krenz's office from outraged citizens and party members at a time when the SED was preparing for its 11th Party Congress. Rudolf Hellmann said: \"The referees should lead confidently, especially now before the XI. Party Congress.\" Honecker wanted quiet. The DFV Presidium and its General Secretary Zimmermann took the opportunity to take action. An example was consequently made of Stumpf and he was eventually sanctioned with a lifetime ban from refereeing. The sanction against Stumpf was approved by Honecker and Krenz in the SED Central Committee.\n\nThe DFV Referee Commission was now suspended and entirely re-formed. Two SV Dynamo representatives in the referee commission, Heinz Einbeck and Gerhard Kunze were replaced. Among the new members of the DFV Referee Commission were Rudi Glöckner from Markranstädt and Günter Männig from Böhlen. Glöckner became the new head of the DFV Referee Commission after Einbeck. Both Glöckner and Männig came from the Leipzig area. Former employees within the DFV has testified that, at some point in the 1980s, \"all Dynamo people were dropped\" and that \"everyone who came then were good friends of the chairman of 1. FC Lok Leipzig, Peter Gießner\", including the president of the DFV, the general secretary of the DFV and the new head of the DFV Referee Commission: This ended a BFC era. ... The era of 1. FC Lok Leipzig began.\"\n\nEgon Krenz received all DDR-Oberliga referees in July 1986 and swore them to \"pay special attention\" to the BFC in the future. East German football weekly FuWo noted controversial refereeing decisions against BFC Dynamo in several matches of the 1986-87 DDR-Oberliga, including situations where BFC Dynamo were denied penalties and where opposing players could well have received a red card but got away with a yellow card, as well as incorrect offline decisions against BFC Dynamo. As an example, during the match between SG Dynamo Dresden and BFC Dynamo on the 16th matchday, the SG Dynamo Dresden defender Frank Lieberam could have received a red card for his action against the BFC Dynamo striker Andreas Thom in the 79th minute, but referee Adolf Prokop hesitated with regard to the \"atmosphere\" and Lieberam only received a yellow card. SG Dynamo Dresden won the match 3-2. Despite this, BFC Dynamo would still manage to win its ninth consecutive league title at the end of the season.\n\nBernd Stumpf has continuously denied any role in manipulating matches during the East German era. In 2000, Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) was eventually able to publish a previously unknown video recording from the league match between 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and BFC Dynamo on 22 March 1986. The video recording had been filmed by BFC Dynamo for training purposes and showed the controversial situation from a different angle. The video recording showed that penalty was indeed correctly awarded and that the sanction against Stumpf was unjustified. In the video recording, it was possible to see how Hans Richter pushed Bernd Schulz with both hands in the penalty area. In an interview with German newspaper Die Zeit in 2000, Stumpf said: \"The people have never understood how this Leipzig game was used by the highest officials in the party and government.\"\n\nSteffen Karas believes that it should be noted and taken into account that the documents about the 1984-85 season were written at a time when there were documented hard-fought, sports-political power struggles within the SED Politburo, the DTSB and the DFV. Karas points out a number of possible flaws in the DFV report on the 1984-85 season which he believes give the report a somewhat incomplete or one-sided appearance. \n The report lists nine matches where BFC Dynamo was allegedly favored. Karas notes that one of the nine matches was a match between the reserve team BFC Dynamo II and SG Dynamo Dresden, which had no significance for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga. \nThe report listed seven occasions when opposing players had received their third and sixth yellow cards in matches prior to a match against BFC Dynamo and were therefore suspended for the match against BFC Dynamo. Karas shows that 97 players were suspended the 1984-85 DDR-Oberliga, giving an average of 6.97 per team. The number of suspended players against BFC Dynamo (7) was thus not excessive, but rather average. \n The authors of the report on the 1984-85 season regularly refer to descriptions in the East German football weekly FuWo. However, the report makes no mention of the controversial refereeing decisions against BFC Dynamo described in FuWo.  \nKaras raises the question of whether the report may have been prepared for the purpose of legitimizing forthcoming actions? It was not an uncommon occurrence in East Germany. At the time the report was written, the DFV was under political pressure to act against BFC Dynamo. Historians would later also find evidence that other clubs in East Germany also gave special support to referees, especially in the form of valuable gifts.\n\nAfter German reunification, it became known that referee Adolf Prokop had been a Stasi officer, employed as an officer in special service (OibE), and that several other referees, including Bernd Stumpf, had been unofficial collaborators (IM) of the Stasi. But there is no evidence to show that referees were under direct instructions from the Stasi and no document has ever been found in the archives that gave the Stasi a mandate to bribe referees.\n\nAlan McDougall writes that \"the theory that there was a state-sanctioned order to favour the club is shown to be less persuasive than the idea that match officials took preventative action.\" The benefit of controlling important matches in Western Europe, gifts to wives and other forms of patronage, might have put indirect pressure on referees to take preventative action, in so-called \"preemptive obedience\", towards BFC Dynamo. In order to pursue an international career, a referee would need a travel permit, which must be confirmed by the Stasi.\n\nThe German Football Association (DFB) has concluded that \"it emerged after the political transition that Dynamo, as the favorite club of Stasi chief Erich Mielke, received many benefits and in case of doubt, mild pressure was applied in its favor\". However, McDoguall asks: \"If the Stasi was so powerful, why did Mielke wait so long to flex his muscles? If match officials always practised 'pre-emptive obedience' towards BFC, why did it bear fruit only after 1978?\" Adolf Prokop protests against having ever manipulated manipulated matches. He was never banned from refereeing. Prokop said in an interview with German newspaper Die Tageszeitung in 2015 that no East German referee went into a match \"subjectively just to postpone it\" and pointed out that that top teams are viewed with skepticism. Prokop claims that he never received threatening letters from angry fans. He was still invited to nostalgia matches for the East Germany national football team in the 2010s.\n \n\nThe picture that the success of BFC Dynamo relied upon referee bias is dismissed by ex-coach Jürgen Bogs, ex-goalkeeper Bodo Rudwaleit, ex-forward Thom and others associated with the club. Some of them admit that there might have been cases of referee bias. But they insist that it was the thoroughness of their youth work and the quality of their play that earned them their titles. Bogs said in an interview with Frankfurter Rundschau: \"You cannot postpone 26 matches in one season in the DDR-Oberliga. At that time we had the best football team\". Bogs cites a team with strong footballers and modern training methods as the main reasons for the winning streak. The club performed things such as heart rate and lactate measurements during training, which only came to the Bundesliga many years later. Bogs also worked with video evaluations during his period as coach of BFC Dynamo, which was not yet common in East Germany. Bodo Rudwaleit said in an interview with Die Zeit: \"We were a great team. We went out and wanted to show those assholes. It usually worked too. And then mass hysteria: Cheating! BFC referee! Although, with some decisions, I do remember thinking, 'My God! Is that really necessary?' But really, it didn't matter how the referee did, everything was blown out of proportion with us. No one gave me a title, I've worked hard, people should think what they want. What I know, I know all for myself, and that's enough.\" Jörn Lenz said in an interview with CNN: \"Maybe we had a small bonus in the back of referees' minds, in terms of them taking decisions in a more relaxed way in some situations than if they'd been somewhere else, but one can't say it was all manipulated. You can't manipulate 10 league titles. We had the best team in terms of skill, fitness and mentality. We had exceptional players\". Also, former referee Bernd Heynemann, who has testified that he was once greeted in person by Mielke in the locker room at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark, said in an interview with the Leipziger Volkszeitung in 2017: \"The BFC is not ten times champions because the referees only whistled for Dynamo. They were already strong as a bear\".\n\nSouth African-British author Simon Kuper writes in his book \"Football Against the Enemy\" that \"Dynamo won lots of matches with penalties in the 95th minute.\" However, Kuper provides no statistics to support his claim. German author Steffen Karas calculates in his Book \"66 Jahre BFC Dynamo - Auswärts mit 'nem Bus\" that it was actually twice as common for opposing teams to score a match-deciding goal in the 86th minute or later in their wins or draws against BFC Dynamo, during the ten seasons when BFC Dynamo won the DDR-Oberliga than it was for BFC Dynamo in its wins or draws during the same period. Karas claims that BFC Dynamo only scored nine match-deciding goals in the 86th minute or later, in the 218 matches it won or drew during its ten championship years. Only one of those goals came from a penalty. That penalty was the controversial penalty against 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig in the 1985-86 DDR-Oberliga on 22 March 1986, which was later proven to be correct.\n\nAlthough rumours about match manipulation in favor of BFC Dynamo could never be completely dispelled, it is a fact that BFC Dynamo achieved its sporting success much on the basis of its successful youth work. Its youth work during the East German era is still recognized today. Supported by numerous training centers (TZ) of SV Dynamo, the club was able to filter the best talent through nationwide screening and train them in its youth academy. The youth academy had full-time trainers employed for every age group. The top performers of BFC Dynamo in the 1980s came mainly through its own youth teams, such as Frank Terletzki, Hans-Jürgen Riediger, Norbert Trieloff, Bodo Rudwaleit, Artur Ullrich, Rainer Ernst, Bernd Schulz, Christian Backs, Frank Rohde and Andreas Thom. These players influenced the team for years.\n\nIn his book \"Football Against the Enemy\", Simon Kuper also writes that \"Mielke loved his club, and made all the best player in the GDR play for it.\" However, BFC Dynamo recruited fewer established players from the other teams in the DDR-Oberliga than what other clubs did, such as SG Dynamo Dresden and FC Carl Zeiss Jena. Steffen Karas calculates in his book \"66 Jahre BFC Dynamo - Auswärts mit 'nem Bus\" that five of the top 10 delegations in the DDR-Oberliga instead involved FC Carl Zeiss Jena. Only a fifth of the players who won the ten championships with BFC Dynamo were older than 18 years when they joined the club, and those players came from teams that had been relegated from the DDR-Oberliga or the DDR-Liga. The only major transfers to BFC Dynamo from other clubs during its most successful period in the 1980s were Frank Pastor from then-relegated HFC Chemie in 1984 and Thomas Doll from then-relegated FC Hansa Rostock in 1986. Both came from clubs that had been relegated from the DDR-Oberliga. These transfers would often be labeled delegations by supporters of other teams, but Doll left Hansa Rostock to ensure a chance to play for the national team. He had the opportunity to choose between BFC Dynamo and SG Dynamo Dresden but wanted to go to Berlin to be able to stay close to his family and because he already knew players in BFC Dynamo from the national youth teams.\n\nLast titles in East Germany (1986–1989)\n\nRenewed competition in the league (1986–1987)\n\nThe team made a friendly tour to Sweden in August 1986, where it played a number of matches against local teams, including the former opponent from the 1971-72 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, Åtvidabergs FF.\nBFC Dynamo moved its home matches to the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum for the 1986–87 season, as the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark was to be redeveloped. The stadium now had a capacity of  15,000 spectators. Frank Rohde was the new team captain for the 1986–87 season. Jörg Fügner would be used as a regular player during the season. The team was also joined by 20-year-old forward Thomas Doll from F.C. Hansa Rostock. F.C. Hansa Rostock had been relegated to the second tier DDR-Liga after the 1985-86 DDR-Oberliga. Doll and Andreas Thom would form one of the most effective attacking duos in East German football in the late 1980s.\n\nBFC Dynamo opened the 1986-87 DDR-Oberliga with a 4–1 win over FC Vorwärts Frankfurt in front of 12,000 spectators at the Dynamo-Stadion im Sportforum on 16 August 1986.  The team was in first place in the league after the fourth matchday. BFC Dynamo then met local rival 1. FC Union Berlin in the fifth matchday on 13 September 1986. BFC Dynamo won the derby with a massive 8–1 in front of 20,000 spectators at the Stadium der Weltjugend on 13 September 1986.

But the team again had the same number of points as second-placed 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig and only led the league on better goal difference.\n\nBFC Dynamo reached the semi-finals of the 1987-88 FDGB-Pokal. The team was drawn against F.C. Hansa Rostock. The semi-final was played at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 18 May 1988. BFC Dynamo won the match 4-0 and advanced to the final.

Hansa Rostock and Heiko Brestrich left for BSG Stahl Brandenburg after the season.\n\nDisaster in Bremen (1988)\nLong-time club president Manfred Kirste was replaced before the 1988–89 season.

The team was joined by young goalkeeper Oskar Kosche from SG Dynamo Fürstenwalde for the 1988–89 season. Kosche also had a background in the youth department of BFC Dynamo. Young defender Hendrik Herzog would also make recurring appearances with the first team during the season. BFC Dynamo started the 1988-89 DDR-Oberliga with three draws. The team played a 2–2 draw at home against HFC Chemie in the opening match, a 2-2 draw away against BSG Wismut Aue in the second matchday and then a 1–1 draw against 1. FC Union Berlin on the third matchday. The team captured its first win of the league season on the fourth matchday, with a 2–6 win away against FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt on 2 September 1988. Andreas Thom scored two goals, Frank Pastor two goals, Rainer Ernst one goal and Dirk Anders one goal in the match. The team was now in fifth place in the league.\n\nBFC Dynamo qualified for the 1988-89 European Cup as winners of the 1987-88 DDR-Oberliga. The team was drawn against the West German champion SV Werder Bremen in the first round. The first leg was played in front of 24,000 spectators at Friedrich-Jahn-Sportpark on 6 September 1988.  Among the spectators were Erich Mieke and SED First Secretary in East Berlin Günter Schabowski, and among the guests was former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt. Thomas Doll made it 1-0 for BFC Dynamo in the 16th minute of the match. Andreas Thom and Frank Pastor then scored two more goals in the second half. BFC Dynamo sensationally defeated SV Werder Bremen 3–0. Goalkeeper Bodo Rudwaleit was a match hero for BFC Dynamo with numerous saves. BFC Dynamo then played a 1–1 draw away against 1. FC Magdeburg on the fifth matchday on 17 September 1988. The team then met the first-placed SG Dynamo Dresden away on the sixth matchday on 25 September 1988. The score was 0-0 after the first half. Andreas Trautmann and Ulf Kirsten then scored two goals in quick succession for SG Dynamo Dresden. Eike Küttner made it 2–1 in the 63rd minute. but BFC Dynamo failed to equalize. SG Dynamo Dresden won the match 2–1. BFC Dynamo was then set to play the return leg against SV Werner Bremen in the first round of the 1988-89 European Cup. The match was played at the Weser-Stadion on 11 October 1988. SV Werner Bremen would come to dominate the match. BFC Dynamo sensationally lost 5-0 and was eliminated on goal difference. The return leg would become known as \"The Second Miracle on the Weser\". Andreas Thom stated afterwards: \"I can not get worse than this\". Coach Jürgen Bogs summoned up: \"That here, was total shit\".\n\nIt has been rumoured that doping might explain the surprising results in the meeting. Researcher Giselher Spitzer claims that players of BFC Dynamo had been given amphetamines before the first leg. The Stasi allegedly did not want to take this risk in the return leg in Bremen for fear of control. However, a more likely explanation for the surprising loss in Bremen is that the players of BFC Dynamo could not cope with the tremendous media pressure following their home win. Roles had changed during the five-week-long break before the return leg. BFC Dynamo was pushed into the role of favorites, while Werder Bremen was given enough time to build motivation. The match had high political significance: Mielke had made it clear to the team before the return leg that \"this was about beating the class enemy\". Frank Rohde has said: \"You have to consider history, actually, we could only loose\". Goalkeeper Rudwaleit conceded that it was a \"mental thing\". The Stasi also had its explanation for the defeat in Bremen. The Stasi claimed that the main reason for the defeat was that \"the team was not morally and ideologically prepared for the match\" and \"did not have a functioning management that met all the requirements for a stay in Bremen\".\n\nPlayers of BFC Dynamo had apparently also been distracted from their match-day preparations by shopping opportunities. Bogs wanted to travel to Bremen two days in advance. This was denied by the Stasi and the player bus was only allowed to leave East Berlin on Monday morning. The player bus then got stuck in West German morning traffic. Instead of arriving at around 12:00 PM, the bus arrived at 3:00 PM in Bremen. The schedule of Bogs could no longer be held, so the planned shopping tour the day before the match was allegedly cancelled. Werder Bremen Manager Willi Lemke allegedly stopped by the hotel and instead offered a shopping spree for the next day, where players of BFC Dynamo were given the opportunity to buy West German consumer goods at a \"Werder discount\". Some sources suggest that he actually organized a sale at the player hotel where all kinds of goods were sold. According to Bogs, the player bus was completely stocked up with home appliances, televisions and consumer electronics when it arrived at the Weser-Stadion 90 minutes before kick-off. There are allegations that this was purposely done by Lemke for players of BFC Dynamo to lose their concentration. However, the versions of those involved differ. Frank Rohde has many years later claimed that what has been said about the match over the years is \"complete nonsense\" and that \"the process was the same as always with the European Cup\". Bogs was forced to justify himself to the DFV the day after the defeat and would receive a reprimand. BFC Dynamo won the next match 5–1 at home against FC Karl-Marx-Stadt on the ninth matchday on 22 October 1988. Bogs has described the defeat in Bremen as the most spectacular defeat in his career, but not his most bitter. He claims that his most bitter defeat was the 4–1 defeat to Red Star Belgrade on stoppage time in the first round of the 1978–79 UEFA Cup.\n\nDecline in the league and last titles in East Germany (1988–1989)\nBFC Dynamo lost more important points to its league rivals towards the end of the autumn. The team met 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig at home on the tenth matchday on 4 November 1988. BFC Dynamo lost the match 0-2 and conceded its second loss of the league season. The team defeated tenth-placed BSG Energie Cottbus 0–2 away on the following matchday, but then played a 1–1 draw against FC Carl Zeiss Jena at home on the 12th matchday. Young defender Jens-Uwe Zöphel from the youth department made his debut in the DDR-Oberliga in the match against FC Carl Zeiss Jena. BFC Dynamo then met F.C. Hansa Rostock away on the last matchday before the winter break on 3 December 1988. F.C. Hansa Rostock was coached by former BFC Dynamo player Werner Voigt at the time. BFC Dynamo lost the match 1–0. The team finished the first half of the season in fourth place, a full nine points behind first-placed SG Dynamo Dresden. It was the club's worst mid-seasonal result in 14 years. The team had played five draws and conceded three losses in the first 13 matches of the league season. Frank Pastor was the best goal scorer of BFC Dynamo in the league during the first half of the season with six goals. The last season's league top goal scorer Andreas Thom scored five goals. BFC Dynamo met 1. FC Union Berlin in the quarter-finals of the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal. The match was played in front in front of 20,000 spectators at the Stadion an der Alten Försterei on 10 December 1988. Eike Küttner scored 0-1 for BFC Dynamo already in the first match minute. BFC Dynamo eventually won the match 0-2 and advanced to the semi-finals. Fans of 1. FC Union Berlin chanted racist slogans during the match, such as \"Jewish pigs!\".  Andreas Belka left for BSG Energie Cottbus and Thomas Grether for 1. FC Union Berlin during the winter break. Coach Jürgen Bogs and Assistant coach Joachim Hall were called up to the Central Management Office () (BdZL) of SV Dynamo on 15 January 1989. Hall was immediately released from his duties, while Bogs was allowed to remain as coach for the rest of the season.\n\nThe average home attendance had dropped from 15,000 to less than 9,000 during the club's most successful years in the 1980s. Ordinary fans feared the Stasi and had become disillusioned with political interference. Particularly aggravating were the restrictions on ticket sales that the Stasi imposed at international matches for political reasons. Only a small number of tickets have been allowed for ordinary fans during European Cup matches against opponents such as Hamburger SV and SV Werder Bremen. The vast majority of the tickets had instead been allocated to a politically hand-picked audience. BFC Dynamo had also seen the emergence of a well-organized hooligan scene in the 1980s. The development was partly a response to the increasing state repression against the supporter scene. The Stasi had tried to control the supporter scene with a broad catalogue of repressive measures. The supporter scene had been increasingly associated with skinheads and far-right tendencies since the mid-1980s. Right-wing slogans and fascist chants were considered the most challenging forms of provocations, as anti-fascism was one of the founding myths of the East German regime. For young people, being a Nazi was sometimes considered the sharpest form of opposition. However, instances of Nazi provocations did not necessarily reflect genuine political convictions. At least some part of the \"drift to the right\" among East German youth during the 1980s was rooted in a desire to position oneself wherever the state was not. One fan of BFC Dynamo said: \"None of us really knew anything about politics. But to raise your arm in front of the Volkspolizei was a real kick. You did that and for some of them, their whole world just fell apart\".\n\nJens-Uwe Zöphel would make recurring appearances with the first team during the second half of the 1988-89 season. The results in the league would improve after the winter break. The team defeated HFC Chemie 1–4 away on the 14th matchday on 24 February 1989. BFC Dynamo now climbed to second place in the league. The team then defeated BSG Wismut Aue 2–1 at home on the 15th matchday on 4 March 1989. BFC Dynamo was drawn against  FC Rot-Weiß Erfurtin in the semi-finals of the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal. BFC Dynamo won the semi-final 6–1 in front of 7,500 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark on 11 March 1989. Six players of BFC Dynamo scored one goal each in the match, including Zöphel, who scored the 5-0 goal. BFC Dynamo then defeated local rival 1. FC Union Berlin 3–2 on the 16th matchday on the 18 March 1989. 1. FC Union Berlin fielded four former BFC Dynamo players in the starting eleven: Olaf Seier, Thomas Grether, Mario Maek and Norbert Trieloff. The team then met FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt at home on the 17th matchday on 25 March 1989. FC Rot-Weiß Erfurt got a revenge for the semi-final of the FDGB-final and won the match 1–2. BFC Dynamo was then set to play FC Karl-Marx-Stadt in the final of the 1989-89 FDGB-Pokal. The final was played in front of 35,000 spectators at the Stadion der Weltjugend on 1 April 1989. BFC Dynamo was a clear favorite with three national team players in the squad. The score was 0–0 at the half-break. Andreas Thom then made it 1–0 to BFC Dynamo in the 57th minute. BFC Dynamo eventually won the final 1-0 and thus won its third cup title.\n\nBFC Dynamo met first-placed SG Dynamo Dresden at home on the 19th matchday on 19 April 1989. BFC Dynamo  was now in third place in the league, seven points behind SG Dynamo Dresden. Ulf Kirsten made it 0–1 to SG Dynamo Dresden in the 31st match minute, but Eike Küttner equalized 1–1 in the 56th match minute. The match eventually ended 1–1 in front of 18,500 spectators at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark. The opportunity to defend the league title was now practically lost. BFC Dynamo then lost 2–1 away to FC Karl-Marx-Stadt on the 22nd matchday and then 2–4 at home to 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig on the 23rd matchday. SG Dynamo Dresden won the league title on the 23rd matchday, thus breaking BFC Dynamo's ten-year-long dominance in the league. BFC Dynamo was now in third place in the league, nine points behind the new champion SG Dynamo Dresden. BFC Dynamo then played 1–1 against BSG Energie Cottbus on the 24th matchday on 24 May 1989. The team could thus climb to second place in the league, as F.C. Hansa Rostock lost 3–0 away against BSG Stahl Brandenburg at the same time. Young midielder Jörn Lenz from the youth department made his debut for BFC Dynamo in the DDR-Oberliga in the match against BSG Energie Cottbus. Lenz had made his debut with the first team of BFC Dynamo in the first round of the 1988–89 FDGB-Pokal against BSG Energie Cottbus II on 9 September 1988. BFC Dynamo then defeated FC Carl Zeiss Jena 0–1 away on the 24th matchday. The team finally met third-placed F.C. Hansa Rostock on the last matchday on 3 June 1989. F.C. Hansa Rostock was only one point behind in the league. BFC Dynamo won the match 4–0 in front of 9,000 spectators at Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark. The team thus finished the 1988-89 DDR-Oberliga in second place. Andreas Thom and Thomas Doll became the top scorers for BFC Dynamo in the league with 13 goals each. Michael Schulz left for BSG Stahl Henningsdorf after the season.\n\nWith the performance of the team declining in the 1988–89 season and the attendance number continuing to fall, the Central Audit Commission at the Central Management Office (BdZL) of SV Dynamo was authorized by SV Dynamo President Erich Mielke to investigate the club. The Central Management Office had been aggrieved that the special position of the club had enabled it to escape its control. The commission now used the inquiry as an opportunity to cut the overmighty organization down to size. The commission was critical of the inefficient use of resources, materialism, low motivation and lack of political-ideological education of players. As a solution, the Central Management Office assumed full responsibility for the material, political and financial management of the club by mid-1989. Former player Michael Noack would later complain that BFC Dynamo had suffered from triple management: the DFV, the Central Management Office (BdZL) of SV Dynamo and the Stasi, whereby a minority had ruled over the club.\n\nJürgen Bogs was replaced as coach after the 1988–89 season. Helmut Jäschke became the new coach. Jäschke had previously served as a coach of the reserve team BFC Dynamo II. Helmut Koch became the assistant coach of Jäschke. Bogs would later instead take on the role of \"head coach\" () in the club, which was a managerial role in the club at the time. The team was joined by attacking midfielder Heiko Bonan from 1. FC Magdeburg and defender Jörg Buder from the reserve team for the 1989–90 season. A DFV resolution in 1989 had stipulated that a team qualified for a Euopean competition had the right to sign a player from a now-qualified team for a period of at least half a year. As a result of the egulation, Bonan joined BFC Dynamo. Other players signed on the same basis were Damian Halata from 1. FC Magdeburg to 1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig, Andreas Wagenhaus from Hallescher FC Chemie to SG Dynamo Dresden and Uwe Kirchner and Detlef Schößler from 1. FC Magdeburg to SG Dynamo Dresden. As the winner of the 1988-89 FDGB-Pokal, BFC Dynamo was set to play the DFV-Supercup against league champions SG Dynamo Dresden. It was the first edition of the DFV-Supercup. The match was played in front of 22,348 spectators at the Stadion der Freundschaft in Cottbus on 5 August 1989. SED Politburo and Central Committee members Egon Krenz and Erich Mielke, the Head of the Department for Sport of the SED Central Committee Rudolf Hellmann and the DTSB First Vice President Horst Röder were among the spectators. Bernd Schulz made it 1-0 for BFC Dynamo in the 31st minute. Thomas Doll then scored two goals for BFC Dynamo in the middle of the second half. The score was 4–0 for BFC Dynamo at the end of the match. Matthias Sammer then scored one goal for SG Dynamo Dresden in the 87th minute. BFC Dynamo eventually won the match 4-1 and captured the title. BFC Dynamo would eventually be the first and only winner of the DFV-Supercup in the history of East German football.\n\nSee also\n History of Berliner FC Dynamo (1954–1978)\n History of Berliner FC Dynamo (1989–2004)\n History of Berliner FC Dynamo (2004–present)\n\nExplanatory notes\n\nReferences\n\nHistory (1978-1989)\nHistory of association football by club\nHistory of football in Germany\nDynamo Berlin 1978",

        "The Employers' Liability Act 1880 (43 & 44 Vict. c. 42) was an act passed on 7 September 1880 by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It enabled workers to seek compensation for injuries resulting from the negligence of a fellow employee.\n\nBackground\nPrior to the passing of the Employers' Liability Act, it was impossible for a worker to hold his employer responsible for injuries caused by his foreman or another worker's negligence. This was because the standard line of thought on the matter at the time was expressed by the doctrine of Common Employment, which stated that “if the person occasioning and the person suffering the injury are fellow workmen, engaged in a common employment, the employer is not responsible.” This doctrine of Common Employment was first established in the 1837 Priestly v. Fowler decision Another legal principle at the time, supposedly dating back to the origin of English Common Law that “a personal action dies with the person entitled to maintain it,” (Actio personalis moritur cum persona) meant that the family members of a deceased worker could not claim compensation.\nSeveral workmen's associations wished to see the doctrine of Common Employment repealed, as they felt Priestley v Fowler ushered in an unfair and damaging interpretation of the law. In response, Parliament formed a committee to consider evidence on the subject in 1877, and after numerous drafts and revisions, the Employers' Liability Act of 1880 was passed on 7 September. It is probable that the bill was passed as much out of a desire to correct inconsistencies with the fact that employers were responsible for any injuries to strangers caused by those in their employ.\n\nThe Act\nThe act states that any worker (or an immediate family member) is entitled to compensation for injury (or death) when the injury was caused by a defect in equipment or machinery, negligence of any person given authority over the worker by the employer, or an act or omission made by following the orders or bylaws of the employer or their representative. It also specifies that in the case of rail workers, an employer may be held responsible for the negligence of any person in \"control of any signal, points, locomotive engine, or train upon a railway.\"\tThe act also placed limits on how much compensation an injured party (or their representative if deceased) could seek. The maximum was set at what someone in the same job in the same location could have expected to earn in the three years leading up to the injury.\n\nEffects\nThe Employers' Liability Act provided a way for workers to seek compensation when it was demonstrated that the injury was caused by a fellow employee. However, if the person at fault was not a fellow employee – for example, if they were someone working on the same project but contracted to a different employer – then that person's common law liability would remain, and they would be the responsible party. Not all workers opted to rely on this legislation. Many chose instead to participate in benefit plans that were mutually financed by employer and employee, which would provide for compensation in the case of injury. As many as 25% of railway workers may have chosen to rely on these mutual insurance plans.\n\nThe Employers' Liability Act was replaced by the Workmen's Compensation Act 1897, which removed the requirement that the injured party prove who was responsible for the injury – instead they only needed to show that the injury had occurred on the job.\n\nSee also\n United Kingdom labour law\n English tort law\n History of labour law in the United Kingdom\n\nReferences\n\nUnited Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1880\nUnited Kingdom labour law",

For the next decade, he made his living as a traveling pianist in the Midwestern and Southern United States. In 1908, he married and settled down to become a barber.\n\nToward the end of his life, he wrote about ragtime and made recordings. He died in Venice, California. He is buried at Valhalla Memorial Park Cemetery.\n\nCompositions\nNone of Campbell's compositions were copyrighted or published during his lifetime. However, they became known from recordings he made in the 1940s and early 1950s.\n  \nIn 1993, Richard Egan, Jr. published Brun Campbell: The Music of \"The Ragtime Kid\", a collection of transcriptions of Campbell pieces.\n\nIn 2000, David Thomas Roberts recorded an album of Campbell's music, which was released on CD by Pianomania Music Publishing of Roseville, California.\n\n \"Barber Shop Rag\"\n \"Blue Rag\"\n \"Campbell Cakewalk\"\n \"Chestnut Street in the 90s\"\n \"Essay in Ragtime\"\n \"Ginger Snap Rag\"\n \"Grandpa's Stomp\"\n \"Rendezvous Rag\"\n \"Tent Show Rag\"\n \"Reminiscences\"\n \"Slow and Easy\"\n \"Salome Slow Drag\"\n \"Brun's Slow Dog\"\n \"Short Rag\"\n \"Frankie and Johnny Rag\"\n \"Grandpa's Stomp\"\n \"Lulu White\"\n \"Barrelhouse Rag\"\n\nIn fiction\nLarry Karp, who researched and wrote a biography of Campbell, also made him the subject of The Ragtime Kid and The Ragtime Fool, the first and third of a set of four historical novels he called \"Ragtime Mysteries\".\n\nSee also\n List of ragtime composers\n\nReferences\n\nOther sources\n\n1884 births\n1952 deaths\nAmerican male composers\nAmerican composers\nPeople from Oberlin, Kansas\nRagtime composers\nAmerican hairdressers\nRagtime pianists\nAmerican pianists\nBarbers\nAmerican male pianists\n20th-century American male musicians\n20th-century American pianists",

        "Robert Love (11 May 1760 – 17 July 1845) was an American Revolutionary War soldier from Virginia and a political leader in North Carolina.\n\nLove was born near the Tinkling Springs Church in Augusta County, Virginia, the son of Samuel and Dorcas Love. In 1776, he entered military service in the Virginia militia from what is now Wythe County, Virginia, and saw action primarily in the backcountry. In 1776, he served in Colonel William Christian's expedition against the Cherokees.

        "The Robbie Tolan shooting incident took place in Bellaire, Texas, on December 31, 2008, when ten-year Bellaire police veteran Jeffrey Cotton shot unarmed Robbie Tolan, son of major league baseball player Bobby Tolan, in his parents' driveway. Tolan sustained serious injuries in the shooting and charges were pressed against Cotton. On May 11, 2010, a jury reached a verdict of not guilty and Cotton was acquitted. Minority leaders and critics around the country cite the case as an example of racial profiling and institutional racism. A federal civil lawsuit was also filed by the Tolan family. The suit was later settled for $110,000.\n\nBackground\nRobert Tolan (born July 15, 1985) is the son of Major League Baseball player Bobby Tolan of the St. Louis Cardinals and the Cincinnati Reds. He himself played professional baseball for the Washington Nationals organization. Since the shooting incident, he has not played in professional baseball, he last played for the Bay Area Toros. Robbie was shot while Sgt. Cotton was carrying out an investigation suspecting Tolan to be the driver of a stolen vehicle. However, Tolan was the registered owner of the vehicle.\n\nShooting incident\nAround 2:00 a.m. December 31, 2008, Robbie Tolan and his cousin were confronted in their driveway in the predominantly white city of Bellaire, Texas, by police officers who suspected that the young men were driving a stolen vehicle. According to relatives, the two young men were returning from a late night run to Jack in the Box. Tolan's cousin, Anthony Cooper, reported that the police officers emerged from the darkness pointing a flashlight and gun at them. The officer reportedly commanded them to stop before announcing his status as a police officer. After the officer ordered them to get on the ground, Tolan's parents, Marian and Robert Tolan, came outside to attend to the unidentified noise. At this point, Cotton arrived on the scene as backup to the original officer. Robbie Tolan and other family members report that the altercation between Robbie Tolan and Cotton ensued while Robbie Tolan was lying on the porch facing away from his mother and Cotton. After Cotton pushed Tolan's mother up against the garage door, according to the Police statement, Robbie got up from the ground and turned around toward the policeman. Tolan and his mother state that Robbie did not stand, but pushed up from lying on the ground to all fours while turning around. Cotton turned and fired a shot into Robbie Tolan's chest, sending the bullet through his lung and into his liver, where it lodged and threatened his life. Cotton stated that he thought Tolan was reaching for a weapon and reacted quickly in what he thought was self-defense. Evidence of how the bullet entered through his chest and traveled through his body to lodge in his liver suggest that Tolan was on all fours or he was bent over when he was penetrated by the bullet. Afterward Cotton searched Tolan, who was on the ground, and found no weapon on his person. The police department called the shooting tragic and put Cotton on administrative leave, while rejecting that any allegation of racial profiling would be entertained by the police department.\n\nCriminal trial and acquittal\nThe Harris County district attorney's office pressed charges against Cotton for aggravated assault by a public servant in the matter of the shooting of Tolan, claiming that he neglected the basic safety procedures before shooting Tolan. The case involved discussion of racial profiling and racial bias on the part of Cotton; Cotton is white and Tolan is black. The jury featured seven white women, three white men and two black women. Cotton was freed on $20,000 dollar bond while the case was pending. On May 11, 2010, a jury reached a verdict of not guilty and Cotton was acquitted. Minority leaders and critics around the country continue to cite the case as an example of racial profiling and institutional racism. Moreover, the jury declined to convict Cotton on a variety of lesser included offenses including assault, deadly conduct, and reckless endangerment. After the acquittal of Cotton, African American leaders and activists protested outside the police department for what they perceived to be a case of racial bias and injustice.\n\nCivil trial\nPursuant to the allegations of racial bias, profiling, and discrimination, a civil suit was filed against Cotton and the city of Bellaire. The federal civil case was initially dismissed by U.S. District Judge Melinda Harmon of the District Court for the Southern District of Texas based on qualified immunity, then appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, where a three-judge panel upheld the dismissal from the District Court based on qualified immunity. The case was appealed to the full Fifth Circuit Court en banc who also upheld the dismissal based on qualified immunity. After a final appeal to the SCOTUS, the case was returned to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for further review. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals revised its original decision slightly, vacating a small portion of the District Court's decision, and remanded the case back to the District Court for further review. The District Court set a trial date for September 2015. A few days before the trial was scheduled to begin, the federal judge removed the City of Bellaire as a defendant in the lawsuit, which prompted the Tolan family to file a motion for the judge to recuse herself. According to Tolan's mother, on Monday, September 14, 2015, the judge dismissed all of the plaintiff's expert witnesses, but none of the defense's expert witnesses. Robbie Tolan had been under a great deal of emotional distress during the seven-year court proceeding and told his family he did not want to continue the process. While Tolan's mother wanted to continue to fight in this case, the family decided to request a settlement with the City in lieu of a trial. According to local news reports, a settlement was reached with the City of Bellaire for $110,000.\n\nReferences\n\nPolice brutality in the United States\nLaw enforcement in Texas\n2000s crimes in Texas\n2008 in Texas\nDecember 2008 crimes\nDecember 2008 events in the United States\nBellaire, Texas",

        "Ryczywół is a village (a town in 1409–1869) in Masovian Voivodeship, Poland, located in the northern edge of the historic region of Lesser Poland. The village is located along National Road Nr. 79, which goes from Warsaw to Bytom. Ryczywół lies near the confluence of the Radomka and Vistula rivers at the border of Puszcza Stromecka wilderness. The name of the village probably comes from two Polish words - ryczy (bellow) and wół (ox), and comes from herds of cattle, which used to be moved through Ryczywół on the way from Red Ruthenia towards the west.\n\nJan Długosz wrote that in the 13th century Ryczywół already had St. Catherine parish church. In the 14th century, the village belonged to Polish kings, and a royal court was located here. In 1407 it was the seat of a starosta, located in Sandomierz Voivodeship, and two years later Ryczywół was granted town rights by King Władysław Jagiełło. The town, which in the 15th and 16th centuries belonged to several private owners, was famous in the region for a bridge on the Radomka river. Merchants had to pay a toll to cross it. In 1655 during the Swedish invasion of Poland, Ryczywół was destroyed by the Swedes and never regained its importance. In the 18th centuries, Jews started to settle there, and in 1813 whole town was moved some 2.5 kilometers from its original location. This was due to frequent floods of the Radomka and the Vistula. In 1869 the government of the Russian-controlled Congress Poland stripped Ryczywół of its town charter. On 15 September 1939, a battle between the Wehrmacht and Polish units of Łódź Army took place here. Ryczywół was completely destroyed in 1944, during Soviet - German fighting at Warka- Magnuszew bridgehead (see Vistula–Oder Offensive). In 1968–1979, the Kozienice Power Station was built nearby.\n\nHolocaust in Ryczywół\nAt the beginning of World War II, most of the village was burned down by the invading German army, forcing the inhabitants to scatter throughout neighboring villages. In June 1940 there was an outbreak of typhus. The Jewish community of Ryczywół consisted of 160 people. In early 1942 a small ghetto was set up there within the ghettoization process of the entire Radom-Land ordered by Kreishauptmann Friedrich Egen. In August of that year, 160 Jews were sent to Kozienice ghetto and in September, to Treblinka extermination camp, while 69 Jews went to Sobibor on 4 August 1942.\n\nReferences\n\nVillages in Kozienice County\nHolocaust locations in Poland",

        "Donald Richmond Horne  (26 December 1921 – 8 September 2005) was an Australian journalist, writer, social critic, and academic who became one of Australia's best known public intellectuals, from the 1960s until his death.\n\nHorne was a prolific author who published four novels and more than twenty volumes of history, memoir and political and cultural analysis. He also edited The Bulletin, The Observer and Quadrant. His best known work was The Lucky Country (1964), an evaluation of Australian society that questioned many traditional attitudes: \"Australia is a lucky country, run by second-rate people who share its luck.\"\n\nBackground and early years\n\nDonald Horne's early life was recounted in the first volume of his memoirs The Education of Young Donald (1967). He was born in Kogarah, New South Wales and raised in Muswellbrook (where his father was a teacher at the local school) and Sydney. He enrolled in a Bachelor of Arts at the University of Sydney in 1939, but his studies were interrupted by war service. He later attended Canberra University College at the Australian National University, to train as a diplomat. He moved back to Sydney in 1945 without completing his studies. Instead, he wrote for the Daily Telegraph and other Packer  media. Despite never completing an undergraduate degree, in 1973 he was offered a research fellowship in Political Science with the Faculty of Arts by the University of New South Wales. He held several academic positions there for the next fifteen years.\n\nCareer\nHorne began his career in journalism and worked for a number of Frank Packer's publications, first as a journalist for The Telegraph, then editor of the magazine Weekend, and later the fortnightly intellectual periodical The Observer (1958–61). As editor of the flagship magazine The Bulletin (1961–62 and 1967–72), he removed the magazine's long standing motto \"Australia for the White Man\".  He was co-editor of Quadrant magazine (1964–66).\n\nAppointed as a Senior Research Fellow at the University of New South Wales in 1973, Horne was promoted as a professor of political science in 1984, a member of the University Council between 1983–1986 and Chairman of the Faculty of Arts between 1982 and 1986, retiring as emeritus professor. Between 1992 and 1995, Horne served as Chancellor of the University of Canberra.\n\nHe also worked on writing, arts and citizenship boards and was an executive member of the Australian Constitutional Commission. He was Chairman of the Australia Council from 1985-1990.\n\nDespite initial conservative views, he was unorthodox and independent-minded, without a consistent political allegiance.  He was, however, known through much of his public career for his republicanism, a more independent national self-image, his advocacy for the importance of the arts, and a raising in standards of public debate.\n\nHe was still giving media interviews up to the last year of his life, when he died as a result of pulmonary fibrosis after a long illness. His wife and editor, Myfanwy Horne (the daughter of journalist Ross Gollan), later completed his part-written manuscript, published as Dying: a memoir in 2007.\n\nHonours and legacy\nIn 1982, Professor Horne was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia for service to literature; and in 2001 was presented with the Centenary Medal for service to the Centenary of Federation celebrations in New South Wales.\n\nHe was named as one of Australia's Living National Treasures in 1997, the year of the list's inauguration, by the National Trust. \n\nHorne was conferred with degrees honoris causa by a number of Australian academic institutions, including Griffith University (Doctor of the University), University of New South Wales (Doctor of Letters), University of Canberra (Doctor of the University), the Australian Academy of the Humanities (Fellow), and the University of Sydney (Honorary Doctorate: 2005).\n\nIn 2002 he was the recipient of the Australian Humanist of the Year award for his strong advocacy of liberal democracy, multiculturalism, tolerance, republicanism and the recognition of indigenes as Australia’s first people.\n\nIn 2008, the University of Canberra announced the establishment of the Donald Horne Institute for Cultural Heritage.\n\nIn 2016, The Saturday Paper and Aēsop jointly announced the creation of the Horne Prize for essay writing.\n\nIn 2017 La Trobe University Press published Donald Horne: Selected Writings, edited by his son Nick.\n\nSelected bibliography\n\nSocial commentary\n\nPolitical history\n\nAutobiography\n\nFiction\n\nTravel\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n \n \n \n \n\n1921 births\n2005 deaths\n20th-century Australian historians\n20th-century Australian journalists\n20th-century Australian novelists\n20th-century  Australian  economists\n20th-century essayists\n20th-century memoirists\n21st-century Australian historians\n21st-century Australian journalists\n21st-century essayists\n21st-century memoirists\nAustralian activists\nAustralian autobiographers\nAustralian essayists\nAustralian humanists\nAustralian magazine editors\nAustralian male non-fiction writers\nAustralian male novelists\nAustralian memoirists\nAustralian political writers\nAustralian republicans\nAustralian travel writers\nChancellors of the University of Canberra\nDeaths from pulmonary fibrosis\nMass media theorists\nMedia critics\nAcademic staff of the University of New South Wales\nUniversity of Sydney alumni\nWriters about activism and social change",

        "Howard Bruner Schaffer (July 21, 1929 – November 17, 2017) was an American professor and diplomat. A Foreign Service Officer, he served as the U.S. Ambassador to Bangladesh.\n\nFamily and education\nHoward Bruner Schaffer was born on July 21, 1929, in New York City. He had a sister, Doris Schaffer O'Brien, and was married to Teresita Currie Schaffer. He completed his BA. at Harvard University in 1950. Between 1953 and 1955 he attended Columbia University.\n\nCareer\nFrom 1951 to 1953, Schaffer served in the U.S. Army. From 1969 to 1970, he was a scholar at Princeton University and was also an administrator and professor at Georgetown University's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy.  Subsequently, he had a career of thirty-six years in the Foreign service, dealing mainly with America's relations with the South Asia region. His early postings were in New Delhi, Seoul and Kuala Lumpur. He served as political counselor to the American embassies in Pakistan between 1974-1977 and also served as political counselor to the American embassy in India during 1977–1979. He then held the post of U.S. Ambassador to Bangladesh during 1984–1987. Schaffer was twice Deputy Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs in the US State Department.\n\nWorks\nChester Bowles: New Dealer in Cold War\nEllsworth Bunker: Global Troubleshooter, Vietnam Hawk\nThe Limits of Influence: American Role in Kashmir\nHow Pakistan negotiates with the United States: Riding the Roller Coaster\n\nBesides books, Schaffer has also authored several articles on matters related to South Asia.\n\nThe Limts of Influence: America's Role in Kashmir\nRobert Hathaway notes in Foreign Affairs that Schaffer has written an \"exemplary account\" of the United States' efforts to settle or at least manage the Kashmir Conflict. Hathaway observes that Schaffer argues that the time is right for a fresh US initiative to help resolve the Kashmir Conflict.\n\nSurinder Mohan of the Jawaharlal Nehru University notes that it is a \"remarkable\" book which traces the Oval Office's efforts to resolve the Kashmir issue right from the beginning. He observes that the book follows a framework highlighting America's intermittently active and inactive participation from 1948 to the mid 1960s. Mohan observes that the book describes well the failure of all the parties involved: the United Nations, United States, India and Pakistan. While maintaining that it is a fine book Mohan expresses disappointment with the absence of the analysis of the impacts of the 1971 war and Indo-US nuclear deal. Mohan concludes that the book is timely, devoid of jargon and highly accessible. Mohan notes that the book contributes substantially to the literature on the Kashmir conflict and Mohan also recommends that the book be on the desk of every policy-maker and student of the region.\n\nMichael Cotter terms Schaffer's book as outstanding and says it is a must read for those studying the Kashmir Conflict as well as the current Central Asian conflicts. Cottenr observes that while the book concentrates on America's role it also provides a detailed outline of the conflict from its genesis to its contemporary geopolitical impact. According to Cotter, Schaffer is one of the few who can cover the topic thoroughly. Cotter notes that Schaffer's detailed analysis is buttressed with extensive footnotes which take heavily from the official documents from the dispute's early days. Cotter in his conclusion remarks that there is  \"unlikely to be a better textbook example of such a situation than that offered to readers by Howard Schaffer.\n\nChester Bowles: New Dealer in the Cold War\nAccording to John M. Carroll, of Lamar University, Schaffer has written a \"splendid diplomatic biography\" of Chester Bowles. Carroll notes that Schaffer assesses Bowler's diplomatic ideas by \"carefully examining\" his role as American ambassador to India and as Kennedy's undersecretary of state. Carroll observes that one of the many strengths of the book is Schaffer's critical approach to Bowles. Carroll concludes that Schaffer has made an\" enlightening analysis.\"\n\nGary R Hess, of Bowling Green State University,  notes that despite being sympathetic to Bowles, Schaffer has been able to see his flaws. Hess concludes that Schaffer \"deserves high praise for this carefully crafted and thoughtful portrait of Bowles.\"\n\nArlene Lazarowitz, of California State University, states that Bowles career in India was \"rightfully an integral part of Howard B. Schaffer's biography.\" Lazarowitz notes that Schaffer's extensive research reflects Bowles voluminous books, speeches, correspondence and personal knowledge based on Schaffer's experience.\n\nArthur Schlesinger, of the City University of New York, terms Schaffer's book as an \"admirable account\" of Bowles career in foreign affairs. Schlesinger opines that \"In any event, we may be grateful to Schaffer for a just and valuable book.\"\n\nWilliam Allison, of Bowling Green State University, describes Schaffer's book as \"admirable\" and further states that Schaffer deserves praise for his biography while Bowles needs examination. Allison notes Bowles popularity with the Indians while he was America's ambassador to India. According to Allison, since Schaffer worked under Bowles in New Delhi, he knew of his works and methods.\n\nSumit Ganguly notes that Schaffer's book is skilfully written and carefully researched. Ganguly describes Schaffer's account of Bowles as \"succinct\".\n\nDeath\nSchaffer died on November 17, 2017, at the age of 88. Richard Rossow, senior fellow and chairholder of Wadhwani Chair in US-India policy studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies confirmed the news on Twitter and called Schaffer a \"giant\" of US-India relations whose wise counsel and humour would be \"missed.\"\n\nReferences\n\n1929 births\n2017 deaths\nAmbassadors of the United States to Bangladesh\nAmerican expatriates in India\nAmerican expatriates in Pakistan\nAmerican scholars of Pakistan studies\nColumbia University alumni\nHarvard University alumni\nUnited States Army soldiers\nUnited States Foreign Service personnel\nDiplomats from New York City\nAcademics from New York City",

        "Ariconium was a road station of Roman Britain mentioned in Iter XIII of the Iter Britanniarum of the Antonine Itineraries. It was located at Bury Hill in the parish of Weston under Penyard, about  east of Ross on Wye, Herefordshire, and about  southeast of Hereford. The site existed prior to the Roman era, and then came under Roman control.  It was abandoned, perhaps shortly after 360, but precisely when and under what circumstances is unknown.\n\nDiscovered as a result of efforts to map the stations of the Antonine Itineraries, research and excavation have provided the only information on its history, to date showing it to have been a place of bloom furnaces, forges, and iron working throughout its existence.\n\nContext \nThe Forest of Dean and nearby areas were an ancient source of iron ore and charcoal. There is evidence of early mining and smelting, and there were many sites consisting of groups of forges. The site of Ariconium was on the rise of a hill, where airflow is increased due to the terrain. This favoured the establishment of bloomeries, an ancient process that produced imperfect iron, together with cinders, dirt, and unreduced oxide. A Roman contribution was the use of bellows, causing an air blast that was hotter and produced better but unforgeable iron, requiring a further refining by reheating, and using a great deal of charcoal. The cinder refuse or scoriae was dumped in great piles at such sites.\n\nDiscovery of the site\nIn the early years of serious research into the locations of stations on the Antonine Itineraries, the location of Ariconium was in doubt, and William Camden (1551–1623) suggested Magnis, the site of modern Kenchester, some  northwest of modern Hereford. Later analysis of the Antonine Itineraries, notably by John Horsley (1685–1732), refined previous estimates and ultimately placed Ariconium at Bury Hill, Weston under Penyard,   west-northwest of Glevum (at modern Gloucester), and  northeast of Blestium (at modern Monmouth). With confidence that the overgrown ruins near Weston under Penyard were actually the site of Ariconium, local people began clearing away the brush, revealing the enormous magnitude of the cinder piles, and further revealing the walls of buildings. Stories emerged of significant Roman-era relics, and there were unverified stories that existing relics having no provenance had actually been found in Ariconium.\n\nSuch capable modern research as has been done so far supports the characterisation of a large iron working site with massive refuse piles covering approximately , pottery remnants, and numerous artefacts.  Finds have included pre-Roman British coins, including one minted by Cunobelin, and  coins from the Roman arrival until 360, after which there are no coins found.\n\nHistory \nThe site was occupied by the pre-Roman Britons, likely as part of an iron working industry.  It was continually occupied throughout the Roman era, and the scale of industrial activity increased over the period.  It is clear that there was a focus of settlement activity near Bromsash, but the area appears to some archaeologists to have contained dispersed centres of activity and settlement rather than a Roman town. Ariconium's only documented significance is as a station on Iter XIII of the Iter Britanniarum, with the single mention there being its only mention in classical history.\n\nIt seems to have been abandoned shortly after 360. Its sudden abandonment is consistent with a violent end, and may be related to the collapse of authority and widespread marauding at that time, as reported by Ammianus, a situation that lasted for almost a decade, and from which parts of Roman Britain never recovered. Evidence of later occupation of the site has not been found.\n\nThe name \nThe origin of the name Ariconium is uncertain, as is its pre-Roman name. The Romans often named a place in recognition of some feature of the terrain, or in recognition of the people then living in the area. There is a similarity to other Roman place-names such as Viroconium (post-Roman Welsh: Caer Guricon), also known as Uriconium, but as yet no established connection to them.\n\nIt is generally believed that Ariconium is the origin of the name of the post-Roman kingdom of Ergyng, although Ariconium was located outside the later boundaries of Ergyng. It is plausible that both derive from an earlier name for a wider area.  In turn, Ergyng is believed to have given its name to Archenfield.\n\nSince 2008, it has been used as the name of a united benefice of six Church of England parishes in the area - Aston Ingham, Hope Mansell, Lea, Linton, Upton Bishop and Weston under Penyard.\n\nIn literature \nAs with many other places in Britain, there have been speculative articles written that connect Ariconium to the characters in Arthurian tales. Some are careful with their wording and state that they are not asserting historical facts; others are less careful and propagate fiction in the guise of hypothesis.\n\nThere are occasional mentions of Ariconium in poetic works, but there is nothing to connect them with the Ariconium of this article. They may be references to Kenchester at a time when Camden placed the site there, or to a similar-sounding word such as Uriconium, or to some other place or person; or as works of poetry, they may refer to nothing in particular at all.\n\nReferences \nBibliography\n\nNotes\n\nHistory of metallurgy\nIron Age sites in England\nRoman towns and cities in England\nArchaeological sites in Herefordshire",

        "Jeffrey Barret Wetherby (born October 18, 1963, in Granada Hills, California, United States) is an American former professional baseball outfielder who played for the Atlanta Braves of the Major League Baseball (MLB) in 1989.\n\nCareer\nPrior to playing professionally, Wetherby attended Kennedy High School and then College of the Canyons and University of Southern California. He was originally drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 10th round of the 1984 MLB draft, however he did not sign. He was then drafted by the Braves in the 21st round of the 1985 MLB draft, signing.\n\nWetherby made his MLB debut with the Braves on June 7, 1989, at the age of 25. In his first career at-bat, pinch hitting for Geronimo Berroa, Wetherby singled to drive in base runner Dale Murphy. A few days later Wetherby had pinch hits in back to back games at the Astrodome. He thus was 3 for 3 in his first three MLB at bats and all three were pinch hits. On September 2, pinch hitting for Tony Castillo, Wetherby hit his first and only MLB career home run off of future Braves pitcher Greg Maddux. On October 1, he appeared in his final MLB game.\n\nOverall, Wetherby spent 52 games with the Braves in 1989, hitting .208 with two doubles, one triple and one home run. He was used mostly as a pinch hitter, appearing in only nine games in the field.\n\nDespite having a short MLB career, Wetherby enjoyed an eight-year minor league career. In 771 minor league games, Wetherby hit .283 with 156 doubles, 17 triples and 52 home runs. He collected 740 hits in 2,614 at-bats. In 1987 with the Greenville Braves, he hit .303 with 31 doubles, four triples and 12 home runs in 140 games.\n\nOn March 18, 1990, he was traded by the Braves with minor leaguer Miguel Sabino to the Cleveland Indians for Tommy Hinzo.  He is currently a scout for the Detroit Tigers.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1963 births\nLiving people\nAmerican expatriate baseball players in Canada\nAtlanta Braves players\nBaseball players from Los Angeles\nCalgary Cannons players\nCollege of the Canyons Cougars baseball players\nColorado Springs Sky Sox players\nDetroit Tigers scouts\nDurham Bulls players\nGreenville Braves players\nGulf Coast Braves players\nJacksonville Suns players\nMajor League Baseball outfielders\nPeople from Granada Hills, Los Angeles\nRichmond Braves players\nRochester Red Wings players\nSumter Braves players\nUSC Trojans baseball players\nAlaska Goldpanners of Fairbanks players",

He studied art under Thomas Eakins at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and under Frank Vincent DuMond at the Art Students League in New York City before completing his training in Paris. After returning to the United States, he made his home in New Rochelle, New York.\n\nHis illustrations appeared in the children's magazine St. Nicholas, as well as magazines for broader audiences, such as Munsey's.\n\nIn 1897, a publishing house chose Relyea to illustrate The Rubáiyát of Doc Sifers, Hoosier poet James Whitcomb Riley's poem satirizing The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam. Because Relyea was not from Indiana, Riley insisted that he visit the state before making his drawings, to ensure that he would not misrepresent Indiana or caricature its residents.\n\nPersonal life\nRelyea was married in 1892. His wife Eloise divorced him in 1920, winning alimony of $25 per week. After the marriage collapsed, she remained in New Rochelle and he was reported to be living in his studio in the Bronx.\n\nSelected works\nBooks with illustrations by Charles M.

The group, whose alumni include composer/arranger David Foster, disbanded after the lukewarm reception of their second album, Two of its other members, Donny Gerard and Carl Graves achieved mixed success in other projects.\n\nTheir biggest single, \"Wildflower\", was a 1972 number #1 hit in Canada on the RPM Adult Contemporary chart; it reached number 10 on the Canadian RPM singles chart and then peaked at number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 the following spring, selling over a million copies. It was written by guitarist Doug Edwards and Dave Richardson, who was a Victoria police officer at the time. The song's popularity was boosted by frequent play on CKLW-AM radio after its initial release.\n\nDonny Gerrard was amongst the Canadian musicians who recorded the 1985 charity single for African famine relief entitled \"Tears Are Not Enough\". He sang his solo line with Bryan Adams.\n\nDoug Edwards died on November 11, 2016. Donny Gerrard died from cancer in February 2022, at the age of 75.\n\nFormer members\n B.J.

Aeolus was the first satellite capable of observing what the winds are doing on Earth, from the surface of the planet and into the stratosphere 30 km high.\n\nThe satellite was named after Aeolus, a god from the Greek mythology, the ruler of the winds.\n\nProgram \nThe program was initially approved in 1999 for a 2007 launch but technological obstacles caused 11 years of delay, as it was launched on 22 August 2018. For an estimated €481 million (US$568 million) program cost, it was planned to provide 64,000 daily profiles from March or April 2019. Its altitude was a low  for enough backscattered light sensibility, inducing a short 3 years life expectancy.\n\nMission \nAeolus was the fifth planned satellite in the Living Planet Programme (LPP) of the European Space Agency. The main goal of this mission was to further develop the knowledge of Earth's atmosphere and weather systems. By recording and monitoring the weather in different parts of the world, Aeolus allowed scientists to build complex weather models, which could then be used to help predict how that environment will behave in the future. These predictions were useful in the short-term, since they could be applied to numerical weather prediction in order to make forecasts more accurate. The mission thus improved the knowledge of all sorts of weather phenomena, from global warming to the effects of air pollution. Aeolus was seen as a mission that paved the way for future operational meteorological satellites dedicated to study Earth's wind profiles.\n\nSatellite \nThe spacecraft was built by Airbus Defence and Space. In 2014, the integration of ALADIN instrument was completed and vacuum along with vibration testing begun. On 7 September 2016, ESA and Arianespace signed a contract to secure the launch of the Aeolus satellite.\n\nScientific payload \nThe wind-component profiles was measured by the Atmospheric LAser Doppler INstrument (ALADIN).\n\nALADIN \nThe ALADIN instrument (Atmospheric Laser Doppler Instrument) was a direct detection ultraviolet laser lidar consisting of three major elements: a transmitter, a combined Mie and Rayleigh backscattering receiver assembly, and a Cassegrain telescope with a  diameter. The transmitter architecture was based on a 150 mJ pulsed diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser, frequency-tripled to provide 60 millijoules pulses of ultraviolet light at 355 nm. This frequency was chosen because of the increased Rayleigh scattering in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum, and because it was eye-safe at distances greater than several hundred metres. The Mie receiver consisted of a Fizeau interferometer with a resolution of 100 MHz (equivalent to 18 m/s). The received backscatter signal produces a linear fringe whose position was directly linked to the wind velocity; the wind speed was determined by the fringe centroid position to better than a tenth of the resolution (1.8 m/s). The Rayleigh receiver employed a dual-filter Fabry–Pérot interferometer with a 2 GHz resolution and 5 GHz spacing. It analyzed the wings of the Rayleigh spectrum with a CCD; the etalon was split into two zones, which are imaged separately on the detector. The lidar was aimed 35° from nadir and 90° to the satellite track (on the side away from the Sun).\n\nThe processing of the backscatter signals produced line-of-sight wind-component profiles above thick clouds or down to the surface in clear air along the satellite track, every . Wind information in thin cloud or at the tops of thick clouds was also attainable; from the data processing, information on other elements like clouds and aerosols could also be extracted. The data was disseminated to the main numerical weather prediction centres in near-real time.\n\nDevelopment of the ALADIN instrument had been problematic. The ultraviolet laser was causing damage to the optical surfaces in a vacuum. ESA scientists asked NASA for support; however, NASA had minimal experience with lidar of this design. Technology required for the satellite was pushing the technology envelope; therefore, after problematic development, ESA asked Airbus to perform additional full-model tests in a vacuum before continuing mission development. Overall complications involved in the instrument caused an estimated 50% final cost overrun, so ESA had to come up with additional funding for the project.\n\nLaunch \nAeolus was designed to be compatible with many small-capacity launch vehicles such as Vega, Rokot or Dnepr. In November 2013, ESA scheduled the launch on a VEGA in one of the five flights of the VERTA Programme, but in 2015 launch was postponed to August 2018 due to problems with their lidar development. A €32.57 million launch contract with Arianespace was signed on 7 September 2016. The launch finally took place on 22 August 2018 on a Vega launch vehicle from French Guiana at 18:20 local time.\n\nOperations \nThe satellite was launched on 22 August 2018. Three months of testing was conducted before including data in weather models. One year of usage had resulted in reduced power from the primary laser. After switching to the second laser, the instrument was meeting mission objectives.\n\nIn mid-2019, ESA determined that the UV laser was losing power: it started with pulses of 65 millijoules once it reached orbit, but that energy declined 20 to 30% in the first nine months, and was losing one millijoule per week in May 2019. ESA then decided to switch to a backup laser that had not been used, offering the opportunity to complete the expected 3 year life of the satellite. The report also said that the satellite's orbit at 320 km required re-boosting every week, limiting the satellite's life to the available propellant.\n\nThe satellite was supported by the Europe-wide collaboration Aeolus DISC (Data, Innovation, and Science Cluster) which aims to improve the quality of the data. Aeolus DISC did fly thousands of kilometers from Greenland to Cape Verde to calibrate and validate the data taken by Aeolus. Aeolus was also supported by the international collaboration JATAC (Joint Aeolus Tropical Atlantic Campaign), which took measurements with ground-based remote sensing instruments, especially lidars, drones and radiosondes attached to weather balloons. These measurements were used to calibrate and validate the measurements by Aeolus.\n\nOn 30 April 2023, all nominal operations were concluded in preparation for a series of end-of-life activities. A controlled reentry into the atmosphere was planned. ESOC conducted an 'assisted re-entry', using a mixture of natural air drag and commanded delta-v. Aeolus re-entered the atmosphere over Antarctica on 28 July 2023.\n\nImpact \nIn 2020 it was reported that measurements from Aeolus enabled ECMWF to partly compensate for reduced measurements from commercial aircraft at the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. \n\nIn September 2021, since it was launched three years ago, Aeolus had far exceeded expectations and frequently hailed a remarkable success. It was developed as a research mission and to demonstrate how novel laser technology could deliver vertical profiles of Earth's wind. These measurements were much needed, for example by the World Meteorological Organization's Global Observing System, which is a coordinated system of methods and facilities for making meteorological and environmental observations on a global scale.\n\nAeolus improved short-range forecasts, particularly in the tropics and at mid-latitudes. It might even improve hurricane forecasts, especially in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, where reconnaissance aircraft data are unavailable.\n\nSince ECMWF started assimilating Aeolus data in 2020 the satellite became one of the highest impact-per-observation instruments in existence. Aeolus created an economic benefit of €3.5 billion for Europe. Aeolus Mission Manager, Tommaso Parrinello, called Aeolus \"one of the most successful missions ever flown by ESA\". A follow-up mission, called Aeolus-2, will be launched within a decade after the mission end.\n\nSee also \n\n BIOMASS\n CryoSat and CryoSat-2\n EarthCARE\n FLEX\n Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE)\n Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS)\n Swarm\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n Aeolus page at Airbus Defence and Space \n Aeolus pages at ESA, with latest news\n Aeolus blog by Gilles Labruyère, mechanics engineer in the Aeolus project\n\nEarth observation satellites of the European Space Agency\nSpacecraft launched in 2018\nSpacecraft launched by Vega rockets\n2018 in French Guiana\nSpacecraft which reentered in 2023",

        "Łysa Góra  (Bald Mountain; also known as Łysiec or Święty Krzyż) is a well-known hill in Świętokrzyskie Mountains, Poland. With a height of 595 metres (1,952 ft), it is the second highest point in that range (after Łysica at 612 meters or 2,008 ft). On its slopes and atop its summit are several hiking trails, the ruins of a pagan wall from 9th century, the Benedictine monastery Święty Krzyż from the 11th century (destroyed during the Second World War, now partially restored), and a Święty Krzyż TV Tower. The mountain also features prominently in a local legend about witches' sabbaths.\n\nLocation\nŁysa Góra, composed primarily of quartzite and Cambrian slates, lies in the eastern part of the Łysogóry range, and is the second largest peak of the larger Świętokrzyskie Mountains (after Łysica). A notable summit within the Świętokrzyski National Park, it is a vital point in many sightseeing trails of the region. The blue path to Pętkowice begins here, and the red path from Gołoszyce to Kuźniaki passes through here.\n\nNotable landmarks\n\nDuring the times of prehistory of Poland, Łysa Góra was likely a sacred mountain and a site of a pagan temple of three gods, mentioned in the Annals of Jan Długosz. There are remains of a quartzite U-shaped wall surrounding the higher part of the hill, with length of about 1.5 km and height of 2m from 8th-10th centuries. The temple was abandoned after the baptism of Poland. The legend about witches' sabbaths is likely related to the old cult.\n\nOn the site of the pagan temple the Benedictine monastery of Holy Cross (Święty Krzyż) was founded (according to a legend, in 1006, by king of Poland, Bolesław I the Brave, but most sources give the 11th century). The monastery was named after a fragment from Christ' Cross which was supposedly enshrined there, and was a site of frequent pilgrimages. The monastery was destroyed and rebuilt several times throughout its history, with the most significant destruction taking place in the 19th and 20th centuries. After the Partitions of Poland, the Russian Empire took over the building in 1819 and converted it into a prison. It was partially restored during the interwar period after Poland regained independence. During World War II, the German occupiers murdered the abbot of the monastery during a massacre of Poles committed on 12 June 1940 in Kielce (see: Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland). and the monastery was taken over by the Nazi Germany and used as a prison and execution site of Soviet prisoners of war (about 6,000 perished here). After the war, the Polish communist government transferred the building to the Świętokrzyski National Park, which renovated parts of them. Currently the National Park has a museum in some of the former buildings, while a part has been taken over by another religious institute (Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate). Due to its cultural and historical importance, the abbey complex is listed as a Historic Monument of Poland. The abbey, although now past its Golden Age, has given its names to the Świętokrzyskie Mountains range as well as the Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship itself. The abbey also holds some mummified bodies; one of them is rumored (but not confirmed) to belong to Prince Jeremi Wiśniowiecki.\n\nAnother notable building found on the hill is the Święty Krzyż TV Tower; the tallest free-standing TV tower in Poland. Built in 1966, it is a 157 metre tall concrete tower.\n\nThe Soviet prisoners executed by the Nazis are buried in a mass grave near the peak. At the bottom of the hill, there is a monument to Poles who died in the Katyn massacre.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\n Brocken\n Lysa Hora\n\nReferences\n  Łysa Góra, entry in PWN Encyklopedia\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links\n\n  Święty Krzyż - Sanktuarium  Relikwii Drzewa Krzyża Świętego\n\nMountains of Poland\nLandforms of Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship",

        "The GVB (Golfvaardigheidsbewijs in Dutch, Brevet d´aptitude in French) or golf ability license is a standardised test and licensing process which players of the game of golf must go through in order to be allowed to play on many golf courses in Belgium or the Netherlands.\n\nHistory\nThe GVB was introduced because there are few golf courses in relation to the number of golfers. Because there was no requirement previous to the GVB, anyone could play on a public course. This led to situations which were hazardous or undesirable to other players. In the 1980s the GVB was introduced (in Belgium in 1988) to remedy this problem. The GVB is basically a pre-handicap. It guarantees a certain level of ability and knowledge of the rules and etiquette. The GVB is required for entrance into a golfing association or to play on an official golfing association course although most clubs have their own admittance policy.\n\nSome clubs and courses (like in a lot of other countries) demand a handicap certificate or certifiable level of play (i.e. handicap 24) for guests.\n\nLevel of play\nIn the Netherlands there are three types of level of play:\n Baanpermissie (course permission): the local pro has determined that the player is good enough to go out on the local course (but only the local course).\n Golfvaardigheidsbewijs (GVB): the player has taken a test and is deemed good enough to obtain the GVB. The player can play on any course where GVB is the minimal requirement.\n Handicap: the player has taken the handicap exam and has played the required number of holes with a score deemed eligible for a handicap. The player can now play any course for which the handicap is the minimum requirement.\n\nMany club players skip the GVB part and go straight to the handicap exam.\n\nThe GVB test\nThe test comprises a written portion and a practical portion. The written portion is twenty questions; five about etiquette, the other fifteen about the rules. The practical portion consists of playing four holes. The player's best three holes are counted; the player must score below 21 to pass the test.\n\nPlayers are free to choose a course to take their test. Some clubs or courses offer a package deal where one attains a GVB after a weekend of workshops, learning and training.\n\nIt is not necessary for a player to be member of a club or course in the Netherlands to have a GVB or a handicap. The player can register with the Stichting Golfsport for a fee and the GVB or handicap will be maintained (even if it is not a Dutch GVB or handicap).\n\nExternal links\n Information about the GVB  \n NGF (Dutch Golf Federation) website \n Royal Belgian Golf Federation website \n Luxemburg Golf Federation website\n\nReferences\n\nGolf in the Netherlands\nGolf in Belgium\nGolf terminology",

        "Monsieur Tranquille is a character in the Canadian children's television series Patof voyage. He is well known for the 1977 disco hit Ma'm Thibault. He was portrayed by actor-comedian Roger Giguère.\n\nChildren's TV shows\nMr. Tranquille is first mentioned in the television series Patof raconte (CFTM-TV, 1975). Played by the soundman Roger Giguère, he is an invisible character who interacts with the clown Patof through sound and music effects. It is only in the series Patof voyage (CFTM-TV, 1976) that Roger Giguère embodies him as a puppet.\n\nLesley Tranquille (a play on words meaning \"leave him alone\") quickly captures the hearts of children. In January 1977, a single titled Madame Thibault becomes a number one hit in Quebec. A disco version of the song, mostly instrumental except for the phrase \"Ma'm Thibault,\" is created and becomes a club hit. The single is even released in France and Australia, where it gains immense popularity. The song is credited to \"Tranquille\" to differentiate it from the TV character and is also included on a K-tel double-LP compilation called Disco Fever (1978).\n\nIn September 1977, Mr. Tranquille received his own television series called Monsieur Tranquille (CFTM-TV, 1977). To enhance the character's popularity, two LPs, several coloring books and posters, as well as a series of eight comic books illustrated by Henri Desclez, were published.\n\nThe following season, a new series titled Le monde de Monsieur Tranquille (CFTM-TV, 1978) was created with a more educational focus. However, the series was canceled midway through the season, largely due to competition with the highly popular Bobino on rival Ici Radio-Canada Télé, which aired in the same timeslot.\n\nDespite having a short career, Mr. Tranquille captured the imagination of a generation of Québécois. Songs such Faut pas me chercher (a duet  with Patof, 1976), Madame Thibault (1977), Ça va pas dans l'soulier? (1977), Les monstres (1977), Farnande (1977) and Pepperoni are among his greatest hits.\n\nFilmography\n\nTelevision series\n 1975-1976 Patof raconte\n 1976-1977 Patof voyage\n 1977-1978 Monsieur Tranquille\n 1978 Le monde de Monsieur Tranquille\n\nDVD\n 2011 Bonjour Patof (Musicor Produits Spéciaux)\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\n\nSingles\n\nEuropean release\n\nAustralian release\n\nCompilations\n\nCollaborations and performances as guest star\n\nCharts\n\nReconstituted chart\n\nSongs \nTitle / Date / Best rank / Weeks on chart\n 1977 Madame Thibault / 1977-01-29 / #1 / 19 weeks on chart\n 1978 Pepperoni / 1978-02-18 / #21 / 3 weeks on chart\n\nAlbums \nTitle / Date / Best rank / Weeks on Top 30\n 1977 Monsieur Tranquille – Faut pas m'chercher / 1977-03-05 / #3 / 12 weeks in Top 30\n\nBibliography\n\nComics \n 1977 Monsieur Tranquille – N° 1 (illustrated by Henri Desclez; text by Claude Leclerc), Éditions Héritage\n 1977 Monsieur Tranquille – N° 2 (illustrated by Henri Desclez; text by Claude Leclerc), Éditions Héritage\n 1977 Monsieur Tranquille – N° 3 : Super-diva (illustrated by Henri Desclez; text by Claude Leclerc), Éditions Héritage\n 1977 Monsieur Tranquille – N° 4 : Un numéro super explosif!

        "La Tablada Rugby Club is a rugby union and field hockey club based in the city of Córdoba, Argentina. Founded in 1943 as a social institution, La Tablada started its sports activities in the 1950s.\n\nHistory\nFirst named \"El Club de la Parroquia de La Tablada\" it was originally a social club founded by members of La Tablada parish in Córdoba.

        "The Vicini family is the wealthiest family in the Dominican Republic and is best known for their vast holdings in the sugar industry. The family business was started by Juan Bautista Vicini Canepa, who migrated to the Dominican Republic from Italy in 1860.\n\nJuan Bautista Vicini \nJuan Bautista Vicini Canepa, was born on February 25, 1847, in Zoagli, a coastal village near Genoa to Angelo Vicini and Anna Canepa. Vicini left Italy and went to the Dominican Republic in 1860 at the age of 21\n.  He was invited to travel to the Dominican Republic as an apprentice to join his countryman Nicole Genevaro who was an exporter of coffee and sugar. After a few years, he purchased the operations belonging to Mr. Genevaro.\n\nJuan Bautista, better known as \"Baciccia\", was very successful in business. Thanks in part to his hard work and his savings, he managed to acquire land for the cultivation of sugar cane.\n\nHis family residence is located on the Avenida Isabel la Católica No. 158, in the city of Santo Domingo, marked with a placard reading J.B. Vicini. This designation is still preserved on the facades of the building belonging to the family. This residence was his place of work. Locals gave it the name Casa Vicini.\n\nEleven children were born of his marriage to Mercedes Laura Perdomo Santamaría. Seven of them went to live with her to Genoa, Italy. While being married, he had an affair with María Burgos Brito and begat 3 children, among them, President Juan Bautista Vicini Burgos.\n\nVicini Canepa, patriarch of the Vicini family, returned only once to Italy and died in 1900 at the age of 53.\n\nFelipe and Juan  Vicini Perdomo \n\nUpon his death, Juan and Felipe Vicini Perdomo, suspended their professional studies in Italy to take over the family business in the Dominican Republic.\n\nFelipe and Juan Vicini Perdomo increased investment to modernize the factory and field work in the sugar, in real estate both in urban and rural areas of the country.\n\nThe political and economic pressure of the Dominican dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo by appropriating all the national wealth, forced the family Vicini Cabral to transfer their residence abroad.\n\nThird generation \n\nThe third generation of the Vicinis was constituted by José María, Juan Bautista (Gianni), Felipe and Laura Vicini Cabral, under the leadership of Gianni; this generation participated actively in the process of overthrowing the dictatorship, the country's economic consolidation and democratic process of the nation.\n\nThe beginning of democracy with the death of Dominican dictator Trujillo in 1961, he found a country where almost all economic areas had been dominated by the dictator and his closest relatives and collaborators.\n\nThe active participation as well as the capital of the Vicini family was instrumental in creating private banks, universities, associations, businesses and nonprofit foundations, all promoters of the country's development and new business that channeled the nation towards development. The family Vicini Cabral participated in those efforts, both as advocates, with financial resources and with the participation and personal presence.\n\nLaura and Felipe Vicini Cabral died childless.\n\nFourth generation\nThe 4th generation of the Vicini entrepreneurial dynasty is comprised by the siblings Amelia Stella, Felipe, and Juan Bautista Vicini Lluberes and their first cousins José Leopoldo and Marco Vicini Pérez.\n\nFamily tree\n\nThe Price of Sugar \n\nThe Vicini Family was depicted in the defamatory documentary The Price of Sugar, a 2007 documentary by Bill Haney about exploitation of Haitian immigrants in the Dominican Republic involved with production of sugar. The documentary shows the poor working conditions in the sugar cane plantations, and describes the actions taken by the Vicini family to stifle efforts to change the situation.\n\nSubjects of the film, Felipe and Juan Bautista Vicini Lluberes, filed a defamation suit on August 31, 2007, against Uncommon Productions and producer Bill Haney, alleging 53 factual inaccuracies.  According to Read McCaffrey, a partner in the law firm Patton Boggs representing the Vicinis, 'The misrepresentation are very egregious and as deceptive as I have seen in a very long time.'\" However, according to the First Circuit Court of Appeals, the Vicini family \"later winnowed the number of allegedly defamatory statements down to seven\". The Appeals Court upheld a judgment from a lower court that the Vicini brothers were \"public figures under the circumstances\". The brothers thus must prove that the filmmakers made false depictions and knew about it. If they had been private figures, as the plaintiffs had unsuccessfully tried to prove, the filmmakers could have been liable for publishing information without verifying its truth. The appeals court sent the case back to the lower court to decide if the filmmakers have to hand over a report that they prepared to obtain insurance coverage for the film. After that, the lower court can determine whether information shown in the film was false and, if it was the case, if the filmmakers knew about it.\n\nReferences\n\nFerran, Fernando.

        "Scenes from Under Childhood is a series of 16mm film in four independent sections by the American experimental filmmaker Stan Brakhage produced between 1967 and 1970. All four sections are silent, though Brakhage made a version with sound available for the first section.\n\nThe film is often described as an attempt by Brakhage to visualize how his children saw the world. In a 2008 Village Voice review, critic J. Hoberman wrote described the film as a \"glorious, two-hour plus romantic epic.\" In a 1992 poll for the British film magazine Sight & Sound, experimental filmmaker Michael Snow named Scenes from Under Childhood as one of the ten greatest films of all time.\n\nWhen asked to describe the film, Brakhage himself wrote that it was \"a visualization of the inner world of foetal beginnings, the infant, the baby, the child – a shattering of the ‘myths of childhood’ through revelation of the extremes of violent terror and overwhelming joy of that world darkened to most adults by their sentimental remembering of it… a ‘tone poem’ for the eye – very inspired by the music of Olivier Messiaen.\"\n\nSections\n\nArchive\nFilm elements for all four sections of Scenes from Under Childhood are held by the Academy Film Archive as part of the Stan Brakhage Collection. Sections 1 and 3 were preserved by the archive in 2018.\n\nSee also\nList of American films of 1967\n\nReferences\n\nAmerican film series\nAmerican independent films\nAvant-garde and experimental film series\nFilm series introduced in 1967\nFilms directed by Stan Brakhage",

        "Brevisomabathynella cunyuensis is a species of crustacean. It was first found in Western Australia. It stands out within its family by its pygmoid body and its long head. At the same time, its mouthparts show: a very large labrum with a great number (over 30) of teeth; its incisor process with four main teeth and three very small other teeth, arranged in two groups; and the distal-inner spines of the farthermost endite of its maxillule being longer than its terminal spines. These distinct characters appear to have developed due to its predatory habits, which in turn are evidenced by the presence of an ostracod prey in its gut. This genus closely resembles the genus Notobathynella.\n\nSee also\nBrevisomabathynella cooperi\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nAbrams, Kym M., et al. \"Molecular phylogenetic, morphological and biogeographic evidence for a new genus of parabathynellid crustaceans (Syncarida: Bathynellacea) from groundwater in an ancient southern Australian landscape.\" Invertebrate systematics 27.2 (2013): 146-172.\nWatts, C.

        "St. John's Lutheran Church, also known as St. John's German Evangelical Church of Walhalla, is a historic church at 301 W. Main Street in Walhalla, South Carolina.\nThere is a preschool run by the church <ref>.\n\nHistory\nThe church was constructed by The German Evangelical Lutheran Congregation to address the inconvenience faced by many Walhalla residents in reaching the nearest church, which was located at a considerable distance <ref>. The planning for the church began in 1858, coinciding with the congregation's decision to allow sermons in English. Ground clearing commenced in early 1859, and construction was completed in 1861. However, the onset of the Civil War presented challenges for the church's management, as a significant portion of the congregation was involved in the Confederate Army. Once they came back, the church faced financial issues due to the prevalence of Confederate notes and other useless forms of paper money in the treasury, though this improved through slight ways. In the later 1860s, a bell was added to the church and kerosene lights replaced candles. Eventually, the bell came out of use, presumably before the replacement of the Town Clock and its pairing bell in 1888. This bell is still in use, shaking the building when it sounds. The original plain glass windows were replaced with stained glass in 1910. Until the 1960s, a major source of lighting for the church was a chandelier, now in the foyer of the parish house. The modern Parish House, Church Office, and Fellowship Hall were built from 1969-1971. The Sunday School Building was renovated in 1973-4. In 1980, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places<ref>.\n\nReferences\n\nWho We Are. (n.d.). St. Johns Evangelical Lutheran Church Walhalla, SC.

        "Astro-Physics, Inc. is a manufacturer of amateur telescopes, mounts, and accessories. Founded in 1975 by former Sundstrand Corporation engineer Roland Christen, the company is noted for its line of apochromatic refractors as well as high-end mounts. The company is located in Machesney Park, Illinois.\n\nThe company is owned by Roland and Marjorie Christen. Author and Astronomy magazine contributing editor Philip S. Harrington wrote in his 2011 book Star Ware: The Amateur Astronomer's Guide to Choosing, Buying, and Using Telescopes and Accessories that Astro-Physics is \"a name immediately recognizable to the connoisseur of fine refractors on rock-steady mounts\".\n\nAstro-Physics was profiled by Travel Channels Made in America, a TV program hosted by John Ratzenberger, on October 25, 2006. In 2006, the company employed 18 people. The company's finished telescopes, which include mounting and lens, cost between $10,000 and $25,000.\n\nAstro-Physics has offered many models of telescopes over the years, distinctive for their apertures and optical designs as well as for their brief periods of production and irregular availability before being discontinued. Past product lines include refractors up to 206mm in aperture, a catadioptric design of 254mm, and an astrograph of 305mm. As of the end of 2021, the company's line of telescopes (optical tubes only, consisting of objective lens, tube, and focuser) included only a 92mm refractor and a 130mm refractor, priced in the $4000–$7000 range. Their more active line of products is three series of computer-controlled \"German\"-style equatorial mounts priced in the $10,000–$20,000 range. (Complete telescopes consisting of both optical tube and mount are not currently offered.) Both the telescopes and the mounts, despite being sought-after, are manufactured in small numbers on an irregular basis. None are maintained in stock, and all typically have long lead times. When available on the used market, Astro-Physics' telescopes and mounts command high prices, telescopes often selling for multiples of their original cost. The company also offers a wide array of telescope, mount and imaging accessories available from stock.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Official website\n\n1975 establishments in Illinois\nCompanies based in Winnebago County, Illinois\nManufacturing companies established in 1975\nManufacturing companies based in Illinois\nTelescope manufacturers",

        "\"Blue Rose\" is a song recorded by Japanese singer Shizuka Kudo, from her ninth studio album, Expose. It was released through Pony Canyon as the album's lead single on March 18, 1994. The song marks a significant change in artistic direction for Kudo, as it is her first single to be self-produced, as well as her first release since parting ways with long-time collaborator Tsugutoshi Gotō, who has helmed Kudo's songwriting team since her solo debut. It was featured on TV commercials for Seagaia Ocean Dome. The single's B-side, \"Door\", is the ending theme to the TX television series Tsumiki Kuzushi: Hōkai, Soshite.... Kudo performed \"Blue Rose\" on the 45th Kōhaku Uta Gassen, marking her seventh consecutive appearance on the show. It is the first in a trilogy of singles with the word \"blue\" in the title: \"Blue Rose\" was later followed by \"Blue Velvet\" and \"Blue Zone\".\n\nBackground\n\"Blue Rose\" was written by Kudo, under the pseudonym Aeri, and Takashi Tsushimi. It is the first single since \"Senryū no Shizuku\" to have Kudo credited as a lyricist. The song is written in the key of C# minor and set to a tempo of 112 beats per minute. Kudo's vocals span from E3 to C5. Lyrically, Kudo incarnates a woman putting it all on the line to seduce a man. She likens her actions to that of a \"sweet devil\" when setting up a \"diamond trap\" for her lover, and declares herself a \"blue angel\" promising to find endless love. The song is noted for having a strong rock aesthetic. It was praised for its copious hard guitar riffs, something out of the ordinary coming from Kudo, who received acclaim for unleashing her wild side on the record and amping up the style and glamour, both musically and visually.\n\nLive performances\nKudo's performances of \"Blue Rose\" are characterized by the accompanying intricate and sensual dance routine, performed alongside multiple backup dancers. The choreography was created by TRF's Sam and Chiharu. Kudo wore a different color variation of the same outfit when performing: a turtleneck crop top, high-slit maxi dress, over-the-knee stockings and platform heels. She wore an all-white version of the ensemble for her Kōhaku Uta Gassen performance. In a retrospective interview, Kudo named Janet Jackson as one of her inspirations for the performance style. Japanese TV personality Mitz Mangrove has praised Kudo for the bold performances and cited her as one of the pioneers of Japanese dancing singers.\n\nChart performance\nThe single debuted at number eight on the Oricon Singles Chart, selling 45,000 copies in its first week. It spent a total of 16 weeks in the top 100; it fell off the charts in June, but charted for a week in January 1994, following Kudo's performance on Kōhaku, when it came back at number 97 before dropping off completely the next week. With over 299,000 copies sold in 1993, it came in at number 89 on the year-end Oricon Singles Chart.\n\nTrack listing\n\nCharts\n\nCertification\n\nReferences\n\n1994 songs\n1994 singles\nSongs with lyrics by Shizuka Kudo\nSongs used as jingles\nShizuka Kudo songs\nPony Canyon singles",

        "There's Always Juliet is a 1931 comedy play by the British writer John Van Druten about an American architect who falls in love with an Englishwoman.\n\nIt ran for 118 performances at the Apollo Theatre in London West End with a cast of Herbert Marshall, Edna Best, May Whitty and Cyril Raymond. It then transferred to Broadway's Empire Theatre with the same cast members. After a fairly lengthy run, however, producer Gilbert Miller was paid by a Hollywood studios to free Marshall for film work. He was eventually replaced by Roger Pryor, but the revived version was less successful.\n\nIn 1941, the play was updated into a loosely adapted film One Night in Lisbon starring Fred MacMurray, Madeleine Carroll and Patricia Morison. May Whitty reprised her role from the original play.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n Bordman, Gerald. American Theatre: A Chronicle of Comedy and Drama, 1930-1969.

        "Antonia Ford Willard (July 23, 1838 – February 14, 1871) was a volunteer civilian spy for the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War.\n\nEarly life\nAntonia Ford was born at Fairfax Court House, Virginia. She was a daughter of a prominent local merchant and ardent secessionist named Edward R. Ford. Before going to the Buckingham Female Collegiate Institute in Buckingham, Virginia, she attended nearby Coombe Cottage, a private finishing school for girls.\n\nAmerican Civil War\n\nAs Union forces occupied the Fairfax region in mid-1861, Ford circulated among the officers and garnered valuable intelligence about troop strengths and planned movements, which she passed along to Brigadier General J.E.B. Stuart, in whose artillery her brother, Charles, served. Ford also spied for John S. Mosby, a noted partisan ranger. Stuart, grateful for her service and appreciative of the information he had received, designated Ford as an honorary aide-de-camp on October 7, 1861.\n\nIn early 1863, Ford was betrayed by a Union counterspy named Frankie Abel, whom she had befriended and shown the document bearing Stuart's signature. Ford was subsequently arrested on March 13 and incarcerated in Washington, D.C., at the Old Capitol Prison. She was accused of playing a prominent role in the capture of Union general Edwin H. Stoughton, but Colonel Mosby and others later denied her complicity, and no evidence of her guilt could be found. She was released and exchanged seven days later. However, she was arrested in Fairfax by Major Joseph Clapp Willard (1820–1897) and sent back to Old Capitol Prison. She took the Oath of Allegiance, he resigned his position in the Union Army, and they subsequently married on March 10, 1864, in Washington, D.C. The couple had three children, only one surviving infancy.\nAntonia Ford Willard died in Washington, D.C. in 1871 as an indirect result of health issues stemming from her captivity. Her husband never remarried. Their son Joseph Edward Willard later became Lieutenant Governor of Virginia and the father-in-law of Kermit Roosevelt .\n\nFord was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.\n\nFilm\nThe 2007 made-for-television docudrama, Now & Forever Yours: Letters to an Old Soldier, artistically recounts the courtship of Antonia Ford and Major Joseph Clapp Willard. It was written and directed by Steven Fischer. In the film, Ford and Willard recount from an ethereal netherworld the events of their two-year affair. This narrative is dramatically illustrated with scenes of the courtship filmed in and around Fairfax, Virginia, where the actual romance took place. Now & Forever Yours: Letters to an Old Soldier was a critical success, winning, among others, an Emmy Award nomination for cinematography. The dialogue between the lovers was taken directly from the couple's surviving letters. The movie starred Katie Tschida and Winston Shearin.\n\nIn 2009, BLM Productions released a feature-length docudrama, Spies in Crinoline, which recounts the intersecting lives of spies Antonia Ford and Laura Ratcliffe.  The screenplay, adapted from Karla Vernon's The Spy in Crinoline and numerous primary sources, intersperses dramatic sequences shot on-location in Fairfax County, Virginia, with period images, narration, and interviews with historians.  Directed by Bert Morgan, it stars Emily Lapisardi as Antonia Ford, Gregory Labenz as Joseph Willard, Becci Varga as Laura Ratcliffe, and Joe Cain as General J.E.B. Stuart.\n\nReferences\n\n Stuart-Mosby Historical Society\n Willard Family Papers, Library of Congress\n\nExternal links\nAntonia Ford in Encyclopedia Virginia\n Library of Congress\n Biography of Ford\n\n1838 births\n1871 deaths\nAmerican Civil War spies\nWomen in the American Civil War\nPeople of Virginia in the American Civil War\nPeople from Fairfax, Virginia\nBurials at Oak Hill Cemetery (Washington, D.C.)\nWomen spies",

        "Houston Driving Park also known as Harrisburg Park was a horse racing track located in the Houston, Magnolia Park neighborhood along Harrisburg Boulevard.  It was opened in 1902, and closed around 1910. The former track is now a residential area.\n\nPlanning and construction\nIn March 1902,  members of the Houston Driving Park Association and the Houston Country Club surveyed an area in Magnolia Park for the grounds of a new race track. With a capacity of 600, grandstands were erected and the park had opened by November 1902.\n\nHouston Lambs tenancy\nIn June 1904, the Houston Driving Park Association began work to temporarily transform the race park into a ballpark for temporary use by the Houston Lambs (later known as the Houston Buffaloes) of the South Texas League.  After being evicted from Herald Park, the ball club eventually played several games at the Houston Driving Park beginning with a game against the Galveston Sandcrabs on July 29, 1904. The club received a new ballpark when West End Park opened the following season.\n\nReferences\n\nSports venues in Houston\nHorse racing venues in Texas\nHouston Buffaloes\nMotorsport venues in Texas\nSports in Houston\nSports venues completed in 1902\n1902 establishments in Texas",

        "Loizidou v. Turkey is a landmark legal case regarding the rights of refugees wishing to return to their former homes and properties.\n\nThe European Court of Human Rights ruled that Titina Loizidou, and consequently all other refugees, have the right to return to their former properties. The ECHR ruled that Turkey had violated Loizidou's human rights under Article I of Protocol I of the European Convention on Human Rights, that she should be allowed to return to her home and that Turkey should pay damages to her. Turkey initially ignored this ruling. \n\nOn 22 July 1989 a Cypriot national Loizidou filed an application against Turkey to the European Court of Human Rights, represented by Greek-Cypriot lawyer Achilleas Demetriades. Loizidou had been forced out of her home during Turkey's invasion of Cyprus in 1974 along with around 200,000 other Greek-Cypriots. During more than 20 years, she made a number of attempts to return to her home in Kyrenia but was denied entry into the Turkish occupied part of Cyprus by the Turkish army.\n\nHer application resulted in three judgments by the European Court of Human Rights (Strasbourg) which held Turkey responsible for human rights violations in the northern part of Cyprus, which is under overall control of the Turkish armed forces.\n\nThe U.S. Department of State commented on this case as follows:\n\nThe court also stated expressly that the damages awarded were not compensation for the property per se, but only for the denial of the ownership and use of the property, and that Loizidou retains full legal ownership of her property.\n\nIn 2003 Turkey paid Loizidou the compensation amounts (of over $1 million) ruled by the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nPrecedent \n\nThe case serves as important precedent for judgments in international courts of law regarding the Cyprus dispute. Similar cases have been brought to the ECHR are awaiting judgement and two have been concluded in a similar fashion:\n May 2007: Myra Xenides v. Turkey, where Myra Xenides was awarded damages for loss of use of her property in Famagusta.\n April 2008: Demades v. Turkey, where Ioannis Demades was awarded damages amounting to €835,000 for loss of use of his Kyrenia property.\n\nThe Loizidou case was also cited in the 2001 judgment on the interstate case Cyprus v. Turkey.\n\nSee also \n Apostolides v Orams\n Eleni Foka\n Greek Cypriots, et al. v.

        "Richard Gerold Purcell Jr. (August 6, 1905 – April 10, 1944) was an American actor best known for playing Marvel Comics' Captain America in the 1943 film serial, co-starring with Lorna Gray and Lionel Atwill. Purcell also appeared in films such as Tough Kid (1938), Accidents Will Happen (1938), Heroes in Blue (1939), Irish Luck (1939), The Bank Dick (1940), and King of the Zombies (1941).\n\nEarly life\nPurcell was born in Greenwich, Connecticut in 1905 (not 1908, as many sources suggest). One of 5 children, he attended Catholic grade school and high school, before enrolling as a student at Fordham University in The Bronx in New York City.\n\nCareer\nPurcell began his acting career on the stage in New York, appearing in at least three plays: Men in White, Sailor, Beware! and Paths of Glory. A talent scout saw Purcell's performance in Paths of Glory which led to a small role in the film Ceiling Zero (1936). In his next film, Man Hunt (1936), Purcell had a larger role as a newspaper reporter. Purcell appeared in eleven films in 1936 alone.\n\nCaptain America serial\nPurcell got the title role in the 1944 Republic serial film Captain America despite being somewhat overweight. The script was loosely based on the comic book character Captain America. The serial has Captain America, whose everyday identity is District Attorney Grant Gardner, thwarting the attempts of The Scarab, the villainous alter ego of museum curator Dr. Cyrus Maldor, to acquire a pair of super weapon devices, the \"Dynamic Vibrator\" and \"Electronic Firebolt\". \n\nThe serial, which would go on to be box office success, would be Republic's most expensive to make but also its last one about a superhero.\n\nPersonal life \nPurcell eloped to Las Vegas with the actress Ethelind Terry. The two married on March 3, 1942, only to divorce on August 26, 1942.\n\nDeath\nShortly after he completed the Captain America film serial, and just before its general release, Purcell collapsed and died in the locker room of a Hollywood country club on 10 April 1944, shortly after playing a round of golf. His remains were interred at Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City. Film historian Raymond Stedman speculated that the strain of filming Captain America was too much for his heart.\n\nSelected filmography\n\n The Doorway to Hell (1930) - Minor Role (uncredited)\n The Strange Love of Molly Louvain (1932) - Jimmy's College Friend (uncredited)\n Ceiling Zero (1936) - Smiley\n Freshman Love (1936) - Radio Announcer (uncredited)\n Man Hunt (1936) - Skip McHenry\n Brides Are Like That (1936) - Dr. Randolph Jenkins\n Snowed Under (1936) - Bert (uncredited)\n Times Square Playboy (1936) - Wally Calhoun\n The Law in Her Hands (1936) - Marty\n Bullets or Ballots (1936) - Ed Driscoll (credited as Richard Purcell)\n Public Enemy's Wife (1936) - Louie\n Bengal Tiger (1936) - Nick DeLargo\n Jailbreak (1936) - Ed Slayden\n The Case of the Velvet Claws (1936) - Crandal\n The Captain's Kid (1936) - George Chester\n King of Hockey (1936) - Gabby Dugan\n Navy Blues (1937) - Russell J.

        "The NM-method or Naszodi–Mendonca method is the operation that can be applied in statistics, econometrics, economics, sociology, and demography to construct counterfactual contingency tables. The method finds the matrix  () which is \"closest\" to matrix  ( called the seed table) in the sense of being ranked the same but with the row and column totals of a target matrix  . While the row totals and column totals of  are known, matrix  itself may not be known.\n\nSince the solution for matrix  is unique, the NM-method is a function: , where  is a row vector of size , while  is a column vector of size .\n\nThe NM-method was developed by Naszodi and Mendonca (2021) (and first applied by Naszodi and Mendonca (2019) to solve for matrix  in problems, where matrix  is not a sample from the population characterized by the row totals and column totals of matrix , but represents another population.\n\nTheir application aimed at quantifying intergenerational changes in the strength of educational homophily and thus measuring the historical change in social inequality between different educational groups in the US between 1980 and 2010. The trend in inequality was found to be U-shaped, supporting the view that with appropriate social and economic policies inequality can be reduced.\n\nDefinition of matrix ranking\nThe closeness between two matrices of the same size can be defined in several ways. The Euclidean distance, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence are two well-known examples.\n\nThe NM-method is consistent with a definition relying on the ordinal Liu-Lu index  which is the slightly modified version of the Coleman-index defined by Eq. (15) in Coleman (1958). According to this definition, matrix  is \"closest\" to matrix , if their Liu-Lu values are the same. In other words, if they are ranked the same by the ordinal Liu-Lu index.\n\nIf  is a 2×2 matrix, its  scalar-valued Liu-Lu index is defined as\n\n , where\n;\n;\n;\n;\n.\n\nFollowing Coleman (1958), this index is interpreted as the “actual minus expected over maximum minus minimum”, where  is the actual value of the  entry of the seed matrix ;  is its expected (integer) value under the counterfactual assumptions that the corresponding row total and column total of  are predetermined, while its interior is random. Also,  is its minimum value if the association between the row variable and the column variable of  is non-negative. Finally,  is the maximum value of  () for given row total  and column total .\n\nFor matrix  of size n×m (, ), the Liu-Lu index was generalized by Naszodi and Mendonca (2021) to a matrix-valued index. One of the  preconditions for the generalization is that the row variable and the column variable of matrix  have to be ordered. Equating the generalized, matrix-valued Liu-Lu index of  with that of matrix  is equivalent to dichotomizing their ordered row variable and ordered column variable  in  ways by explointing the ordered nature of the row and column variables. Than, equating the original, scalar-valued Liu-Lu indices of the 2×2 matrices obtained with the dichotomizations. I.e., for any pair of  (, and ) the restriction  is imposed, where  is the  matrix  with its  being of size , and its  being of size . Similarly,  is the  matrix given by the transpose of  with its  being of size , and its  being of size .\n\nConstraints on the row totals and column totals\nMatrix  should satisfy not only  but also the pair of constraints on its row totals and column totals:  and .\n\nSolution\nAssuming that  for all pairs of  (where , and ), the solution for  is unique, deterministic, and given by a closed-form formula.\n\nFor matrices  and  of size , the  solution is\n\n.\n\nThe other 3 cells of  are uniquely determined by the row totals and column totals. So, this is how the NM-method works for 2×2 seed tables.\n\nFor , and  matrices of size  (, ), the solution is obtained by dichotomizing their ordered row variable and ordered column variable in all possible meaningful ways before solving  number of problems of 2×2 form. Each problem is defined for an  pair ( and ) with , and the target row totals and column totals: , and , respectively. Each problem is to be solved separately by the formula for . The set of solutions determine  number of entries of matrix . Its remaining  elements are uniquely determined by the target row totals and column totals.\n\nNext, let us see how the NM-method works if matrix  is such that the second precondition of  is not met for .\n\nIf  for all pairs of , the solution for  is also unique, deterministic, and given by a closed-form formula. However, the corresponding concept of matrix ranking is slightly different from the one discussed above. Liu and Lu (2006) define it as  , where ;  is the smallest integer being larger than or equal to .\n\nFinally, neither the NM-method, nor  is defined if  pair such that , while for another pair of  .\n\nA numerical example\nConsider the following   complemented with its row totals and column totals and the targets, i.e., the  and  :\n\nAs a first step of the NM-method,   is multiplied by the , and  matrices for each pair of  (, and ). It yields the following 9 matrices of size 2×2 with their target row totals and column totals:\n\nThe next step is to calculate the generalized matrix-valued Liu-Lu index , (where ) by applying the formula of the original scalar-valued Liu-Lu index to each of the 9 matrices:\n\nApparently, matrix  is positive. Therefore, the NM-method is defined. Solving each of the 9 problems of the 2×2 form yields 9 entries of the  matrix. Its other 7 entries are uniquely determined by the target row totals and column totals. The solution for  is:\n\nAnother numerical example taken from Abbott et al.(2019)\nConsider the following   complemented with its row totals and column totals and the targets, i.e., the  and  :\n\nAs a first step of the NM-method,   is multiplied by the , and  matrices for each pair of  (, and ). It yields the following 4 matrices of size 2×2 with their target row totals and column totals:\n\nThe next step is to calculate the generalized matrix-valued Liu-Lu index , (where ) by applying the formula of the original scalar-valued Liu-Lu index to each of the 4 matrices:\n\nApparently, matrix  is positive. Therefore, the NM-method is defined. Solving each of the 4 problems of the 2×2 form yields 4 entries of the  matrix. Its other 5 entries are uniquely determined by the target row totals and column totals.  The solution for  is:\n\nImplementation\nThe NM-method is implemented in Excel, Visual Basic, R, and also in Stata.\n\nApplications\nThe NM-method can be applied to study various phenomena including assortative mating, intergenerational mobility as a type of social mobility, residential segregation, recruitment and talent management.\n\nIn all of these applications, matrices , , and  represent joint distributions of one-to-one matched entities (e.g. husbands and wives, or first born children and mothers, or dwellings and main tenants, or CEOs and companies, or chess instructors and their most talended students) characterized either by a dichotomous categorical variable (e.g. taking values vegetarian/non-vegetarian, Grandmaster/or not), or an ordered multinomial categorical variable (e.g. level of final educational attainment, skiers' ability level, income bracket, category of rental fee, credit rating, FIDE titles). Although the NM-method has a wide range of applicability, all the examples to be presented next are about assortative mating along the education level. In these applications, the two preconditions (of ordered trait variable, and positive assortative mating in all educational groups) are not debated to be met.\n\nAssume that  matrix  characterizes the joint educational distribution of husbands and wives in Zimbabwe, while matrix  characterizes the same in Yemen. Matrix  to be constructed with the NM-method tells us what would be the joint educational distribution of couples in Zimbabwe, if the educational distributions of husbands and wives were the same as in Yemen, while the overall desire for homogamy (also called as aggregate marital preferences in economics, or marital matching social norms/social barriers in sociology) were unchanged.\n\nIn a  second application, matrices  and  characterize the same country in two different years. Matrix  is the joint educational distribution of American newlyweds in 2040, where the husbands are from Generation Z and being young adults when observed. Matrix  is the same but for Generation Y observed in year 2024. By constructing matrix , one can study in the future what would be the educational distribution among the just married American young couples if they sorted into marriages the same way as the males in Generation Z and their partners do, while the education level were the same as among the males in Generation Y and their partners.\n\nIn a  third application, matrices  and  characterize again the same country in two different years. In this application, matrix  is the joint educational distribution of Portuguese young couples (where the male partners' age is between 30 and 34 years) in 2011. And  is the same but it is observed in year 1981. One may aim to construct matrix  in order to study what would have been the educational distribution of Portuguese young couples if they had sorted into marriages like their peers did in 2011, while their gender-specific educational distributions were the same as in 1981.\n\nIn each of the first two applications, matrix  represents a counterfactual joint distribution. It can be used to quantify certain ceteris paribus effects. More precisely, to quantify on a cardinal scale the difference between the directly unobservable degree of marital sorting in Zimbabwe and Yemen, or in Generation Z and Generation Y with a counterfactual decomposition. For the decomposition, the counterfactual table  is used to calculate the contribution of each of the driving forces (i.e., the observed structural availability of potential partners with various education levels determining the opportunities at the population level; and the unobservable non-structural drivers, e.g., aggregate matching preferences, desires, norms, barriers) and that of their interaction (i.e., the effect of changes in aggregate preferences/desires/norms/barriers due to changes in structural availability) to an observable cardinal scaled statistics (e.g. the share of educationally homogamous couples).\n\nThe third application was used by Naszodi and Mendonca (2021) as an example for a non-sense counterfactual: the education level has changed so drastically in Portugal over the three decades studied that this counterfactual is impossible to be obtained.\n\nSome features of the NM-method\nFirst, the NM-method does not yield a meaningful solution if it reaches the limit of its applicability. For instance, in the third application, the NM-method signals with a negative entry in matrix  that the counterfactual is impossible (see: AlternativeMethod_US_1980s_2010s_age3035_main.xls Sheet PT_A1981_P2011_Not_meaningful). In this respect, the NM-method is similar to the linear probability model that signals the same with a predicted probabiity outside the unit interval .\n\nSecond, the NM-method commutes with merging neighboring categories of the row variable and that of the column variable: , where  is the row merging matrix of size ; and , where  is the column merging matrix of size .\n\nThird, the NM-method works even if there are zero entries in matrix .\n\nComparison with the IPF\nThe iterative proportional fitting procedure (IPF) is also a function:. It is the operation of finding the fitted matrix  () which fulfills a set of conditions similar to those met by matrix  constructed with the NM-method. E.g., matrix  is the closest to matrix  but with the row and column totals of the target matrix .\n\nHowever, there are differences between the IPF and the NM-method. The IPF defines closeness of matrices of the same size by the cross-entropy, or the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Accordingly, the IPF compatible concept of distance between the 2×2 matrices  and  is zero, if their crossproduct ratios (also known as the odds ratio) are the same: . To recall, the NM-method's condition for equal ranking of matrices  and  is .\n\nThe following numerical example highlights that the IPF and the NM-method are not identical: . Consider the   with its :\n\nThe NM-method yields the following matrix :\n\nWhereas the solution for matrix  obtained with the IPF is:\n\nThe IPF is equivalent to the maximum likelihood estimator of a joint population distribution, where matrix  (the estimate for the joint population distribution) is calculated from matrix , the observed joint distribution in a random sample taken from the population characterized by the row totals and column totals of matrix . In contrast to the problem solved by the IPF, matrix  is not sampled from this population in the problem that the NM-method was developed to solve. In fact, in the NM-problem, matrices  and  characterize two different populations (either observed simultaneously like in the application for Zimbabwe and Yemen, or observed in two different points in time like in its application for the populations of Generation Z and Generation Y). This difference facilitates the choice between the NM-method and the IPF in empirical applications.\n\nDeming and Stephan(1940), the inventors of the IPF, illustrated the application of their method on a classic maximum likelihood estimation problem, where matrix  was sampled from the population characterized by the row totals and column totals of matrix . They were aware of the fact that in general, the IPF is not suitable for counterfactual predictions: they explicitly warned that their algorithm is “not by itself useful for prediction” (see Stephan and Deming 1940 p. 444).\n\nIn addition, the domains are different for which the IPF and the NM-method yield solutions. First, unlike the NM-method, the IPF does not provide a solution for all seed tables  with zero entries (Csiszár (1975) found necessary and sufficient conditions for applying the IPF with general tables having zero entries). Second, unlike the IPF, the NM-method does not provide a meaningful solution for pairs of matrices  and  defining impossible counterfactuals. Third, the precondition of the NM-method (of either  or ) is not a precondition for the applicability of the IPF.\n\nFinally, unlike the NM, the IPF does not commute with the operation of merging neighboring categories of the row variable and that of the column variable as it is illustrated with a numerical example in Naszodi(2023) (see page 10).\nFor this reason, the transformed table obtained with the IPF can be sensitive to the choice of the number of trait categories.\n\nKenneth Macdonald (2023) \nis at ease with the conclusion by Naszodi (2023) \nthat the IPF is suitable for sampling correction tasks, but not for generation of counterfactuals. Similarly to Naszodi, Macdonald also questions whether the row and column proportional transformations of the IPF preserve the structure of association within a contingency table that allows us to study social mobility.\n\nComparison with the Minimum Euclidean Distance Approach \nThe Minimum Euclidean Distance Approach (MEDA) (defined by Abbott et al., 2019 following Fernández and Rogerson, 2001) is also a function:\n\n.\n\nFirst, MEDA assigns a scalar to matrix : it is the weight used for\nconstructing the convex combination of two extreme cases (random and perfectly assortative matching with the pair of marginals ) by minimizing the Eucledean distance with . E.g. this scalar is  in the\nnumerical example taken from Abbott et al.(2019).\nSecond, for any pair of counterfactual marginal distributions () the MEDA constructs the convex combination of the two extreme cases (random and perfectly assortative matches with the pair of marginals ()).\n\nDifferences between the NM and the MEDA:\nwhile the NM holds the assortativeness unchanged by keeping the generalized matrix-valued Liu-Lu index  fixed, the MEDA does the same by keeping the scalar  fixed.\nFor , and  matrices of size  the two methods produces the same transformed table provided  ranks the contingency tables the same as the scalar-valued Liu-Lu index does.\nHowever, for  matrices larger that 2×2, the\ngeneralized Liu-Lu index is matrix-valued, so it is different from the scalar-valued .\nTherefore, the NM-transformed table is also different from the MEDA-transformed table.\n\nFor instance,\nin the numerical example taken from Abbott et al.(2019), the counterfactual table constructed by MEDA \nis the matrix :\n\nThe difference between matrix  and matrix  is not negligible.\nE.g. the share of homogamous couples is 2 percentage points smaller in the MEDA-constructed counterfactual matrix  than in the observed matrix ,\nwhereas it is 3.4 percentage points smaller in the NM-constructed counterfactual matrix  relative to .\n\nBecause Abbott's example is not a fictional one,\nbut is based on the empirical educational distribution of American couples, therefore\nthe difference between 2 percentage points and 3.4 percentage points can be interpreted as the MEDA quantifies changes in inequality from one generation to another generation to be significantly smaller compared to the NM.\n\nSee also\n Iterative proportional fitting procedure\n\nExternal links\nGeneralized Naszodi-Mendonca method (GNM-method)\n\nReferences \n\nStatistics\nEconometrics",

        "The 17th New York Veteran Infantry Regiment was an infantry regiment that served in the United States Army during the American Civil War. It was often referred to as the 17th New York Veteran Zouaves and has been erroneously reported as using mules as mounts during Sherman's March to the Sea up until the Grand Review of the Armies.  The regiment wore the Hawkins Zouave pattern uniform, which was first used by the 9th New York Volunteer Infantry, Hawkins Zouaves, and later was adopted by several other regiments including the 164th New York, 35th New Jersey and others.\n\nMilitary service, October 1863 to April 1865\nThe regiment was organized in New York City, New York, from June to October 1863, with elements of the 9th (Hawkins' Zouaves), 11th (First Fire Zouaves), 17th, & 38th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiments. The Regiment was mustered into United States service on October 18, 1863, in New York City for three years service with 900 officers and men under the command of Colonel William Thomas Campbell Grower, formerly the major of the 17th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment.\n\nWhen they left the State, they were composed almost wholly of veteran volunteers. Ordered to the Department of the Southwest under Major General Andrew Jackson Smith, they would later join the army of Major General William T. Sherman, and serve under him throughout the remainder of the war.\n\nIn December 1863, under General Andrew J. Smith, the regiment took part in the Tennessee Campaign chasing Confederate Major General Nathan B. Forrest's Cavalry command. Joining Major General William T. Sherman's forces at Vicksburg, Mississippi, in January 1864, the regiment took part in the Meridian Campaign from Vicksburg to Meridian, Mississippi, marching over 460 miles. In April they moved to Decatur, Alabama, where they were engaged in skirmishing with the Confederate forces under Brigadier General Philip D. Roddy, attacking them at Pond Spring, Courtland, etc., and routing them and capturing the whole of their camp. Joining the Army in the operations against Atlanta, Georgia, they took part in the fighting and siege against Atlanta with the 14th Army Corps. On September 1, 1864, at the Battle of Jonesboro they charged and fought against Confederate Major General Patrick R. Cleburne's Division, who boasted to never have been defeated, but who were then broken, routed, and had their works taken from them. It was there that Colonel William T.C. Grower was mortally wounded (dying several days later) and over 150 men left on the field as casualties. From Atlanta they pursued the Confederate Army of Tennessee, under General John Bell Hood, westward, marching over 600 miles back into Tennessee and Alabama. Returning to Atlanta they started the next morning on the March to the Sea from Atlanta to Savannah. Following the fall of Savannah, the regiment rested around Savannah before crossing into South Carolina with the Army. In the Carolina's Campaign they marched through South Carolina into North Carolina, being engaged at Averysboro, North Carolina, where Lieutenant Colonel James Lake was severely wounded. A few days later they took part in their last major engagement at Bentonville, North Carolina, where, despite being completely surrounded, it held off several attacks.\n\nFollowing the surrender of the Confederate Forces under General Joseph E. Johnston on April 26, 1865, at Durham Station, North Carolina, the regiment took part in the rapid march through Richmond, Virginia, and onto Washington, D.C. Camping at Alexandria, Virginia, they took part in the Grand Review of the Army later that month, and were soon thereafter mustered out of service. General William Vandever said of the regiment, \"...In all the essential qualities which distinguish the heroic citizen soldier, the Seventeenth New York has been excelled by none.\" While General Jefferson C. Davis wrote, \"...its soldierly conduct, attention to duty, and invariably gallant conduct in action, has reflected credit upon itself and the corps.\"\n\nMilitary service, 1865\nThe regiment was mustered out of service on June 13, 1865, at Alexandria, Virginia, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel James Lake, with less than 200 officers and men.\n\nCasualties\nThe regiment suffered the following casualties during its service.\n Killed in action: 1 officer, 38 enlisted\n Died of wounds: 1 officer, 16 enlisted\n Died of disease and other causes: 65 enlisted (2 died as POW's)\n Wounded but recovered: 6 officers, 111 enlisted\n Captured or missing: 1 officer, 39 enlisted\n Total: 213 casualties\n\nCommanding officers\n Colonel William Thomas Campbell Grower\n Lieutenant Colonel Edward Jardine\n Lieutenant Colonel James Lake\n Lieutenant Colonel Joel O.

        "West Brit, an abbreviation of West Briton, is a derogatory term for an Irish person who is perceived as Anglophilic in matters of culture or politics. West Britain is a description of Ireland emphasising it as under British influence.\n\nHistory\n\"West Britain\" was used with reference to the Acts of Union 1800 which united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Similarly \"North Britain\" for Scotland used after the 1603 Union of the Crowns and the Acts of Union 1707 connected it to the Kingdom of England (\"South Britain\"). In 1800 Thomas Grady, a Limerick unionist, published a collection of light verse called The West Briton, while an anti-union cartoon depicted an official offering bribes and proclaiming \"God save the King & his Majesty's subjects of west Britain that is to be!\" In 1801 the Latin description of George III on the Great Seal of the Realm was changed from  \"King of Great Britain, France and Ireland\" to  \"King of the Britains\", dropping the claim to the French throne and describing Great Britain and Ireland as \"the Britains\".\n\nIrish unionist MP Thomas Spring Rice (later Lord Monteagle of Brandon) said on 23 April 1834 in the House of Commons in opposing Daniel O'Connell's motion for Repeal of the Union, \"I should prefer the name of West Britain to that of Ireland\". Rice was derided by Henry Grattan later in the same debate: \"He tells us, that he belongs to England, and designates himself as a West Briton.\" Daniel O'Connell himself used the phrase at a pro-Repeal speech in Dublin in February 1836:\n\nHere, O'Connell was hoping that Ireland would soon become as prosperous as \"North Britain\" had become after 1707, but if the Union did not deliver this, then some form of Irish home rule was essential. The Dublin administration as conducted in the 1830s was a halfway house between these two ideals.\n\n\"West Briton\" next came to prominence in a pejorative sense during the land struggle of the 1880s. D. P. Moran, who founded The Leader in 1900, used the term frequently to describe those who he did not consider sufficiently Irish. It was synonymous with those he described as \"Sourfaces\", who had mourned the death of the Queen Victoria in 1901. It included virtually all Church of Ireland Protestants and those Catholics who did not measure up to his definition of \"Irish Irelanders\".\n\nIn 1907, Canon R. S. Ross-Lewin published a collection of loyal Irish poems under the pseudonym \"A County of Clare West Briton\", explaining the epithet in the foreword:\n\nErnest Augustus Boyd's 1924 collection Portraits: real and imaginary included \"A West Briton\", which gave a table of West-Briton responses to keywords:\n{|\n|-\n! Word !! Response\n|-\n|  Sinn Féin   ||  Pro-German\n|-\n|   Irish  ||   Vulgar\n|-\n|  England   ||   Mother-country\n|-\n|  Green   ||   Red\n|-\n|  Nationality   ||   Disloyalty\n|-\n|  Patriotism   ||  O.B.E.\n|-\n| Self-determination || Czecho-Slovakia\n|}\nAccording to Boyd, \"The West Briton is the near Englishman ... an unfriendly caricature, the reductio ad absurdum of the least attractive English characteristics. ... The best that can be said ... is that the species is slowly becoming extinct. ... nationalism has become respectable\". The opposite of the \"West Briton\" Boyd called the \"synthetic Gael\".\n\nAfter the independence of the Irish Free State, \"West British\" was applied mainly to anglophile Roman Catholics, the small number of Catholic unionists, as Protestants were expected to be naturally unionists. This was not automatic, since there were, and are, also Anglo-Irish Protestants favouring Irish republicanism (see Protestant Irish nationalism).\n\nContemporary usage\n\"Brit\" meaning \"British person\", attested in 1884, is pejorative in Irish usage, though used as a value-neutral colloquialism in Great Britain. During the Troubles, among nationalists \"the Brits\" specifically meant the British Army in Northern Ireland.  \"West Brit\" is today used by Irish people, chiefly within Ireland, to criticise a variety of perceived faults of other Irish people:\n \"Revisionism\" (compare historical revisionism and historical negationism): \n Criticism of historical Irish uprisings. (State policy is to praise the patriotism of rebels up to the revolutionary period, while condemning later physical force republicans as antidemocratic.)  \n highlighting perceived benefits of British rule in Ireland\n downplaying British actions during historical events in Ireland such as the Great Famine\n Antipathy to Irish rebel songs.\n Anglophilia: following British popular culture; admiration for the British royal family; support for the Republic of Ireland rejoining the Commonwealth of Nations or becoming a Commonwealth Realm; highlighting positive British influence in the world, past or present\n Cultural cringe: appearing embarrassed by or disdainful of aspects of Irish culture, such as the Irish language, Hiberno-English, Gaelic games, or Irish traditional music\n Partitionism: Opposition or indifference to a United Ireland; showing political support for neo-unionism \nNot all people so labelled may actually be characterised by these stereotypical views and habits.\n\nPublic perception and self-identity can vary.  During his 2011 presidential campaign, Sinn Féin candidate Martin McGuinness criticised what he called West Brit elements of the media, who he said were out to undermine his attempt to win the election. He later said it was an \"off-the-cuff remark\" but did not define for the electorate what (or who) he had meant by the term.\n\nIrish entertainer Terry Wogan, who spent most of his career working for the BBC in Britain, described himself as a West Brit: \"I'm an effete, urban Irishman. I was an avid radio listener as a boy, but it was the BBC, not RTÉ. I was a West Brit from the start. [...] I'm a kind of child of the Pale. I think I was born to succeed here [in the UK]; I have much more freedom than I had in Ireland.\" He became a dual citizen of Ireland and the UK and was eventually knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nThe Irish Times columnist Donald Clarke noted a number of things that may prompt the application of a West Brit label, including being from Dublin (or south Dublin), supporting UK-based football teams, using the phrase \"Boxing Day\", or voting for Fine Gael.\n\nSimilar terms\nCastle Catholic was applied more specifically by Republicans to middle-class Catholics assimilated into the pro-British establishment, after Dublin Castle, the centre of the British administration. Sometimes the exaggerated pronunciation spelling Cawtholic was used to suggest an accent imitative of British Received Pronunciation.\n\nThese identified Catholic unionists whose involvement in the British system was the whole aim of O'Connell's Emancipation Act of 1829. Having and exercising their new legal rights under the Act, Castle Catholics were then rather illogically being pilloried by other Catholics for exercising them to the full.\n\nThe old-fashioned word shoneen (from Irish: Seoinín, diminutive of Seán, thus literally 'Little John', and apparently a reference to John Bull) was applied to those who emulated the homes, habits, lifestyle, pastimes, clothes, and zeitgeist of the Protestant Ascendancy. P. W. Joyce's English As We Speak It in Ireland defines it as \"a gentleman in a small way: a would-be gentleman who puts on superior airs.\" The Irish historian and academic, F. S. L. Lyons, defined a \"shoneen\" as a person \"of native Irish stock who committed the unforgivable sin of aping English or West-Briton manners and attitudes\".\n\nSimilar to shoneen, another variant since c. 1840, jackeen ('Little Jack'), was used in the countryside in reference to Dubliners with British sympathies; it is a pun, substituting the nickname Jack for John, as a reference to the Union Jack, the British flag. In the 20th century, jackeen took on the more generalized meaning of \"a self-assertive worthless fellow\".\n\nAntonyms\nThe term is sometimes contrasted with Little Irelander, a derogatory term for an Irish person who is seen as an extreme nationalist, Anglophobic and xenophobic, while sometimes also practising Traditionalist Catholicism. The term was popularised by Seán Ó Faoláin. On the RTÉ program The Live Mike between 1978 and 1982, sketch comedian Dermot Morgan satirised \"Little Irelanders\", by playing a bigoted GAA member who waved his hurley around while verbally attacking his pet hates.\n\n\"Little Englander\" had been an equivalent term in British politics since about 1859.\n\nAn antonym of jackeen, in its modern sense of an urban (and strongly British-influenced) Dubliner, is culchie, referring to an unsophisticated Irish person who resides in the countryside.\n\nSee also\n\nPlastic Paddy\nMore Irish than the Irish themselves\nPom or pommy\n\nReferences\n\nPejorative terms for European people\nAnti-British sentiment\nForeign relations of Ireland\nPolitics of Ireland\nIrish slang\nIreland–United Kingdom relations",

        "The Heretics is a 2017 Canadian body horror film directed by Chad Archibald and produced by Black Fawn Films and Breakthrough Entertainment. It is about a young woman who is kidnapped and transforms into a demon.\n\nPlot\nGloria is kidnapped by a cult which, under a locust moon, performs an occult ritual while wearing grotesque masks before committing suicide. A locust moon is the appearance of the moon in late spring after the \"Flower Moon\" of May. Five years later, a traumatized Gloria is living with her mother, Ruth. Slowly recovering from her experience, Gloria attends a therapy group at her local church with her lover Joan. Joan tells Gloria she has something special planned for their anniversary tomorrow. But on the night before their anniversary, Gloria is kidnapped by Thomas, a man whose face is hideously scarred by fire, and taken to a remote cabin in the countryside.\n\nJoan launches an increasingly frenetic search for Gloria, and pulls a knife on a man who is indifferent to Gloria's kidnapping. When a police officer learns of Joan's violent behaviour, he suspects that she was involved in Gloria's kidnapping, which leads her to kill both him and the inconvenient witness Ruth. Thomas tells Gloria that he was one of the cultists who had kidnapped her five years ago, and that he was moved by her humanity, which caused him to abandon his beliefs on that night. He feigned suicide, and states that he kidnapped her to protect her from the remaining cultists, who intend to finish the ritual under the coming locust moon. The cultists believed that they had implanted the demon Abaddon, the \"Taker of Souls\", into Gloria's body and that it has been growing inside of her for the last five years.\n\nUnder the light of the locust moon, Gloria becomes seriously ill and begs Thomas to take her to a hospital. Both Thomas and Gloria experience visions of Abaddon while various occurrences suggest a malevolent supernatural force is present in the cabin. As Gloria begins to grow wings, Thomas starts to believe she really is turning into Abaddon, and contemplates killing her before the transformation is complete. Joan is revealed to be the leader of the cult who kidnapped Gloria. Thomas tells Gloria that Joan is really his sadistic sister Gwendolyn who scarred him with fire. Gloria, whose appearance is increasingly inhuman as her metamorphosis processes, starts to lose herself mentally and begins to speak in the voice of Abaddon, saying she will kill him first and take his soul to hell.  \n\nGwendolyn learns from a man who witnessed the second kidnapping that the kidnapper had a scarred face, which leads her to deduce that it was Thomas. Gwendolyn goes to the cabin (which belonged to their parents), knocks out Thomas, taunts Gloria over her physical degeneration, and begins to perform an occult ritual before a chained Gloria. Thomas breaks free, kills Gwen and takes a seemingly dead Gloria outside under a rising sun. Gloria revives and attacks him, saying in the voice of Abaddon that she will take his soul to hell.\n\nCast\n Nina Kiri – Gloria\n Ry Barrett – Thomas\n Jorja Cadence – Gwendolyn\n Will King – Kent\n Nina Richmond – Ruth\n Austin Duffy – Abaddon\n\nProduction\nThe film was financed by Breakthrough Entertainment as the last in a two-year eight-picture deal with Black Fawn Films, signed in June 2014, at about $500,000 each. Chad Archibald directed the film, which was written by Jayme LaForest.\n\nThe film was shot in Toronto, Erin and Guelph, Ontario.\n\nDistribution and release\nThe Heretics premiered at the 11th edition of the Canadian Film Festival in Toronto, on 22 March 2017.  Jason Anderson of the Toronto Star called it \"a standout\" among the new features. The eight-picture deal with Breakthrough had solidified Black Fawn's reputation, and their films were universally welcomed at horror film festivals.  The Heretics was also screened at the 2017 Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nToronto-based distributor A71 obtained the Canadian rights to the film, which was released at 15 Landmark Cinemas theatres across the country on 1 November 2017 as a special event screening, followed by a week-long national release beginning 3 November. Breakthrough Entertainment distributed the film internationally. A71 partnered with Black Fawn to release the film on DVD and Blu-ray in early 2018.\n\nReception\nIn a review, critic Ricky Church praised the acting and felt that the direction and special effects made the best use of the film's modest budget. The website CultureCrypt in a review stated: \"Overall, The Heretics is a satisfying, if ultimately adequate, horror movie featuring cults, crazies, and a cabin in the woods. Even though it isn't a standout in Black Fawn and Chad Archibald's complete catalog, it isn't a weak film on its own merit\". Critic Andrew Mack called The Heretics Archibald's \"...best work to date. With a familiar narrative he still manages a couple surprises to keep it interesting. His cast contains a reliable stalwart and lets us know that there are a couple of femme fatales emerging on the horizon.\" In a review, critic Josh Hancock called The Heretics a  \"stylish, well-made horror film\" that told a \"captivating story\" with good performances from the cast.\n\nIn a review on Horror Fuel website, the critic Dan XIII praised Kiri's performance, writing: \"Kiri makes for a great lead who can go from vulnerable victim, to strong survivor, to off-kilter possessed with equal skill and aplomb, and make no mistake...this film is her showcase.\" Critic Luke Rodriguez felt that the film would have benefited from additional takes of key scenes to provide more even performances. Nevertheless, he declared that: \"The  Heretics is a modern marvel of independent genre cinema. When you consider the confines that Chad Archibald and team had to work within to make this happen, and the final product that they delivered, it's hard to fathom how the hell it's even possible.\"\n\nA review on the website Let the Movies Move Us stated: \"The Heretics justifies the genre of horror, as some scenes, musical score and even the make-up do their job perfectly. The plot itself was a bit flat and uninspiring, which unfortunately was visible to the naked eye. The actors, however, do a decent job despite the screenplay, again, that was not that richly written. However, in spite of bumpy moments, The Heretics [...] is not a bad movie at all. And I am sure with good publicity it might reach a wider audience, who will appreciate it more than I did. It just happened that I was not the right one...\" A review on the website Anatomy Of A Scream stated: \"Where The Heretics lacks in character development, it makes up for in motivation. We never fully understand why Gloria has been chosen as the cult's vessel, but that's exactly what she is: a shiny vessel to deliver what they were promised. And that transformation is pretty impressive. The slimy black gunk of hell oozing out of Gloria is unsettling and disturbing while the mental gymnastics of what's really happening to her leaves you disoriented and creeped out.\"\n\nIn the Winnipeg Free Press, critic Randall King compared the film to the bigger-budget Ontario-shot horror The Void, writing that The Heretics is \"comparatively stripped of cast, and outré visual effects, aiming instead for dramatic potency to push its concept over the top.\"\n\nAwards\nKiri was awarded the Best Actress prize at the Buffalo Dreams Fantastic Film Festival for her performance in The Heretics.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n2017 films\n2017 horror films\n2017 horror thriller films\nCanadian body horror films\nCanadian supernatural horror films\nCanadian independent films\nCanadian LGBT-related films\nEnglish-language Canadian films\nFilms about cults\nFilms about kidnapping\nLesbian-related films\nLGBT-related horror films\nLGBT-related thriller films\n2017 LGBT-related films\n2010s English-language films\n2010s Canadian films",

        "George Joseph \"Mike\" Kelly Jr. (born May 10, 1948) is an American politician and businessman who has been a U.S. representative since 2011, currently representing . The district, numbered as the 3rd district from 2011 to 2019, is based in Erie and stretches from the northwest corner of the state to the outer northern suburbs of Pittsburgh.\n\nA member of the Republican Party, Kelly is known for his support of Donald Trump, characterizing the 2019 effort to impeach Trump as akin to Pearl Harbor and filing a lawsuit in state court to invalidate all mail-in ballots cast in Pennsylvania during the 2020 United States presidential election.\n\nOn October 22, 2021, it was reported that a congressional ethics watchdog had recommended subpoenaing Kelly for an ethics violation after it was revealed that his wife had purchased stock in an Ohio-based steel company in April 2020 after Kelly had received confidential information about the company. In June 2022, Senator Ron Johnson revealed that Kelly was responsible for providing a slate of fake electors meant to overturn Pennsylvania's electoral votes in the 2020 election. Kelly's office has denied his role in this event.\n\nEducation and early career\nKelly was born on May 10, 1948, in Pittsburgh, but has spent most of his life in the outer northern suburb of Butler. He attended the University of Notre Dame.\n\nAutomotive business\nAfter college, Kelly worked for his father's Chevrolet/Cadillac car dealership. In 1995, he took over the business, and added Hyundai and KIA to its lineup.\n\nIn March 2019, a local TV station discovered that 17 vehicles were for sale on Kelly's Uniontown and Butler lots that were the subject of recall notices but had not been repaired. The station contacted both the businesses and Kelly's office without receiving responses. A month later, a reporter found three of those vehicles with active recalls still for sale. In November 2015, Kelly had spoken on the floor of Congress in support of a bill that would have allowed dealers to loan or rent vehicles despite National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) safety recall notices on them. Kelly had said, \"There is not a single person in our business that would ever put one of our owners in a defective car or a car with a recall. But that could happen. That could happen.\" The bill did not pass.\n\nKelly's car dealerships received Paycheck Protection Program loans of between $450,000 and $1.05 million to keep staff on the payroll during the coronavirus pandemic. Paycheck Protection Programs loans saved over 160 jobs at Kelly's family-owned dealerships. The loans were designed to keep employees on payroll during the COVID-19. Former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf deemed automobile dealerships \"non-essential\" during the pandemic, which forced Kelly's dealerships to close and allowed the dealerships to accept PPP loans.\n\nUnited States House of Representatives\n\nCommittees & Caucuses \nKelly is a top Republican on the powerful and influential U.S. House of Representatives' Ways & Means Committee. He currently chairs the Subcommittee on Tax, which oversees tax policy, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and more. Kelly also sits on the Ways & Means Committee's Subcommittee on Health, which oversees Medicare policy. He previously served as the top Republican on the Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight. Kelly has served on the Ways & Means Committee since 2013.\n\nKelly belongs to more than 20 caucuses in the U.S. House of Representatives. He chairs or co-chairs several prominent caucuses, including the following: \n\n Congressional Cancer Caucus\n Congressional Childhood Cancer Caucus\n House Automotive Caucus\n Friends of Ireland Caucus\n House Small Brewers Caucus\n Congressional Caucus on Korea\n Northern Border Security Caucus\n\nElections\n\n2010 \n\nKelly challenged incumbent Representative Kathy Dahlkemper in 2010. He won the election by 10%, largely by running up his margins outside of heavily Democratic Erie.\n\n2012 \n\nKelly defeated Democrat Missa Eaton 55%–41%. His district had been made slightly friendlier in redistricting. The district was pushed slightly south, absorbing some rural and Republican territory east of Pittsburgh. At the same time, eastern Erie County was drawn into the heavily Republican 5th district. The 3rd and 5th were drawn so that the boundary between the two districts was almost coextensive with the eastern boundary of the city of Erie.\n\n2014 \n\nKelly defeated Democrat Dan LaVallee of Cranberry Township 60.5%–39.5%.\n\n2016 \n\nKelly ran unopposed and received 100% of the vote.\n\n2018 \n\nAfter the Pennsylvania Supreme Court threw out Pennsylvania's original congressional map in February 2018, Kelly's district was renumbered the 16th and made slightly more compact. It regained the eastern portion of Erie County that had been drawn into the 5th. To make up for the increase in population, its southern portion was pushed to the west, leaving Kelly's hometown of Butler just barely inside the district.\n\nPoliticsPA wrote that the new 16th was far less safe for Kelly than the old 3rd, citing a Public Policy Polling poll showing him leading Democratic nominee Ron DiNicola 48% to 43%, below the threshold to be considered safe for a fourth term. Additionally, while Trump carried the old 3rd with 61% of the vote, he would have carried the new 16th with 58% of the vote. Nate Cohn of The New York Times suggested that Kelly would have been in more danger had the 16th absorbed more Democratic-leaning territory northwest of Pittsburgh. Ultimately, much of this territory had been drawn into the reconfigured 17th district (the former 12th district).\n\nKelly defeated DiNicola 51.6%–47.2%, his first close contest since his initial run for the seat.\n\n2020 \n\nKelly defeated Democrat Kristy Gnibus of Erie 59.34%–40.66%, an improvement over his performance in 2018. He received 210,088 votes to Gnibus's 143,962. He likely got coattails from Trump, who carried the district with 59% of the vote.\n\nCommittee assignments \n Committee on Ways and Means\nSubcommittee on Oversight (Ranking Member)\nSubcommittee on Health\n\nCaucus memberships \n\n Northeast-Midwest Congressional Coalition \n Republican Study Committee\n\nTenure\n\nConservative Political Action Conference attendance \nIn February 2021, Kelly and a dozen other Republican House members skipped votes and enlisted others to vote for them, citing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. But he and the other members were actually attending the Conservative Political Action Conference, which was held at the same time as their absences. In response, the Campaign for Accountability, an ethics watchdog group, filed a complaint with the House Committee on Ethics and requested an investigation into Kelly and the other lawmakers.\n\nDebt forgiveness \nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, Kelly's auto dealerships received loans from US taxpayers of over $970,000 as part of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP); the loans were later forgiven. U.S. Representative Katie Porter later introduced legislation that would require all loans under the PPP to be made public. Kelly voted against the TRUTH Act (H.R. 6782), a bill that would have required public disclosure of companies that received funds through the bailout program. As of August 2022, Kelly opposes President Joe Biden's proposal to forgive $10,000 of student debt for individuals making up to $125,000 per year. Kelly's net worth was estimated to be $12.4 million in 2018.\n\n\"Deep state\" conspiracy theories \nWhen speaking at a Mercer County Republican Party event in 2017, Kelly advanced the conspiracy theory that former president Barack Obama was running a \"shadow government\" to undermine President Trump. When asked about these remarks, Kelly said they were meant to be private. After the remarks made national news, Kelly's spokesperson said that Kelly did not believe that Obama \"is personally operating a shadow government\".\n\nDonald Trump \n\nKelly has argued against the release of Trump's tax returns by the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nIn December 2019, Kelly likened Trump's first impeachment to the Attack on Pearl Harbor. He said the date on which Trump was impeached is \"another date that will live in infamy\", referring to President Franklin Roosevelt's statement about the Pearl Harbor attack.\n\nAmid ballot counting in the 2020 election, Kelly filed a lawsuit to stop Pennsylvania from allowing voters to \"cure\" (fix mistakes on) their ballots. After Biden won Pennsylvania, Kelly filed a suit arguing that all mail-in ballots cast in the state (more than 2.5 million) should be discarded, which would result in flipping the state to Trump, or if that was not possible, that the electors for president should instead be chosen by the legislature. If successful, this suit would have retroactively disenfranchised millions of voters in the Pennsylvania election. On November 28, 2020, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court unanimously rejected Kelly's suit, additionally ruling to \"dismiss with prejudice.\"\n\nIn December 2020, Kelly was one of 126 Republican members of the House of Representatives to sign an amicus brief in support of Texas v. Pennsylvania, a lawsuit filed at the United States Supreme Court contesting the results of the 2020 presidential election, in which Biden defeated Trump. The Supreme Court declined to hear the case on the basis that Texas lacked standing under Article III of the Constitution to challenge the results of an election held by another state.\n\nEconomy \nIn March 2021, all House Republicans including Kelly voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill.\n\nHealthcare \nOn August 1, 2012, Kelly called the HHS mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) - which requires health insurers or employers that provide their employees with health insurance to cover some contraceptive costs in their health insurance plans - an attack on Americans' constitutionally protected religious rights and said that August 1, 2012, would go down in infamy as \"the day that religious freedom died\".\n\nLGBT rights \nIn 2015, Kelly cosponsored a resolution to amend the US constitution to ban same-sex marriage. In 2022, he was one of 157 Republicans to vote against a bill protecting same-sex and interracial marriage.\n\nAwards & Honors \nKelly has a record of bipartisanship and working across the aisle to pass legislation. In three consecutive Congresses, Kelly landed in the top one-third of most bipartisan members, according to The Lugar Center and Georgetown University's McCourt School of Public Policy.\n\nKelly is among the leading members of Congress regarding constituent services. From 2018-2020, Kelly and his staff were named finalists for the Congressional Management Foundation's Constituent Service Award.\n\nPersonal life \nKelly lives in Butler, Pennsylvania, with his wife Victoria. They have four children and ten grandchildren. He is the brother-in-law of retired Congressman Phil Roe of Tennessee's 1st congressional district. He is Catholic. In 2019, he said that, as a person of Irish and Anglo-Saxon descent, he considers himself a person of color—a term often used to describe people of nonwhite backgrounds.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Congressman Mike Kelly official U.S. House website\n Mike Kelly for Congress\n \n \n \n\n|-\n\n|-\n\n1948 births\n21st-century American politicians\nAmerican automobile salespeople\nAmerican Roman Catholics\nBusinesspeople from Pennsylvania\nCatholics from Pennsylvania\nLiving people\nPennsylvania city council members\nPeople from Butler, Pennsylvania\nRepublican Party members of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania\nSchool board members in Pennsylvania\nAmerican conspiracy theorists",

        "Thomas DeMarco (born January 16, 1989) is a former professional Canadian football quarterback. He played for the BC Lions, Ottawa Redblacks and the Edmonton Eskimos of the Canadian Football League (CFL).\n\nCollege career\n\nCollege of the Desert\nDeMarco started his collegiate career at College of the Desert in Palm Desert. While there, he passed for 1,792 yards and 14 touchdowns during the 2008 season. He also rushed for 8 touchdowns.\n\nOld Dominion\nIn 2009, DeMarco transferred to Old Dominion University. DeMarco dressed for 35 games over three seasons at Old Dominion and started 27 times. He passed for 5,732 yards with a 57.7 completion percentage and racked up 51 touchdowns.\nDeMarco also ran for 1,456 yards and 30 TDs.  As a junior in 2010, DeMarco ranked seventh nationally in total offence at 289 yards per game. He was named as an Honorable Mention All-American in 2010 by Consensus Draft Services. During a game against University of Massachusetts in 2011, a defensive end rolled over his ankle. True freshman Taylor Heinicke would play the rest of the game, later becoming the Monarchs' starting quarterback.\n\nProfessional career\n\nBC Lions\nWhile DeMarco did not get drafted by a National Football League team, he signed a two-year deal with the BC Lions on May 14, 2012. He started the season as the Lions' third-string quarterback, behind Travis Lulay and Mike Reilly. On October 6, 2012, DeMarco made his pro debut against the Calgary Stampeders, completing 3 of 6 passes for 35 yards; his first completion was a five-yard pass to Geroy Simon.\n\nDuring the 2012 offseason, Reilly was traded to the Edmonton Eskimos, making DeMarco the backup to Lulay. Despite his small size for a quarterback, DeMarco found a niche as the Lions' short-yardage quarterback.\n\nOn September 15, 2013, DeMarco (while in relief of an injured Lulay) threw his first career touchdown, a 14-yard pass to Marco Iannuzzi against the Montreal Alouettes.\n\nThe following week, DeMarco would get the start (due to Lulay's shoulder injury) against the Saskatchewan Roughriders. He led the team on a late drive down the field, which set up a 42-yard Paul McCallum field goal to win the game 24-22. He finished the game going 18 for 33, with 208 yards and 2 touchdowns. DeMarco would struggle the following weeks, eventually getting replaced by Buck Pierce during the October 19 game against Edmonton. Lulay returned as starter for the playoffs, but the Lions were eliminated by the eventual Grey Cup Champions, Saskatchewan. DeMarco finished the year with 1,325 yards passing, 10 touchdowns and 8 interceptions.\n\nOttawa Redblacks\nOn December 16, 2013, Ottawa selected quarterbacks DeMarco and Kevin Glenn (from Calgary) in the first round of the 2013 CFL Expansion Draft (the first round being designated for Imports). On February 4, 2014, after being released by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, quarterback and veteran CFLer Henry Burris signed a three-year contract with the Redblacks, thus creating a quarterback controversy between Burris, Glenn, and DeMarco. On May 13, 2014, Glenn was traded to the BC Lions during the 2014 CFL Draft in exchange for the fifth overall pick in that draft. DeMarco began the season as the 2nd string QB behind veteran Henry Burris. DeMarco only appeared in 4 games in the 2014 CFL season before suffering a season-ending ACL tear in his left knee. He has the unusual distinction of punting for the first Redblacks touchdown at TD Place Stadium when his onside punt was recovered for a touchdown by Dobson Collins on August 2, 2014. DeMarco dressed for all 18 regular season games and three post-season games in 2015, but played sparingly due to the health and strong play by league MOP, Henry Burris. He became a free agent on February 9, 2016.\n\nEdmonton Eskimos\nDeMarco signed as a free agent with the Edmonton Eskimos on April 16, 2016. He was released July 10, 2016. The Eskimos' starting quarterback Mike Reilly got banged up in the first round of the playoffs, which prompted the Eskimos to sign DeMarco back to their roster ahead of the Eastern Final. DeMarco was released by the Eskimos on December 13, 2016.\n\nPersonal\nDeMarco has a major from Old Dominion in Business Management. He is currently working towards his Master of Business Administration.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOttawa RedBlacks bio\n\n1989 births\nLiving people\nAmerican football quarterbacks\nAmerican players of Canadian football\nBC Lions players\nCanadian football quarterbacks\nEdmonton Elks players\nOld Dominion Monarchs football players\nOttawa Redblacks players\nPeople from Palm Desert, California\nPlayers of American football from Riverside County, California\nPalm Desert High School alumni\nCollege of the Desert Roadrunners football players",

        "Agustín Leonardo was a Spanish painter of the Baroque period.\n\nHe was born in Valencia, and took up the habit of the Order of Mercy at Xàtiva. In 1620 he was a brother in the convent of that order at Puig near Valencia, where he painted for the sacristy four large canvases: Finding the Image of Our Lady at Puig, Siege and Surrender of Valencia to King James; and the Battle of the Puig in which St. George fought with Christians. He afterwards visited Seville, where he painted a Christ and the Samarian Woman (1624). In 1624-5 he was called to Madrid, where he painted two pictures for the great staircase of the Convent of Mercy. He excelled in portraiture, and painted a portrait of Gabriel Bocangel, the poet.

        "Louis King Johnson, Jr. (born December 27, 1987), better known by his stage name King Louie (or King L), is an American rapper. Spin Magazine attributed King Louie as being one of the Chicago rappers who made Chicago the \"hottest hip-hop\" scene in 2012.\n\nEarly life \nKing Louie was born Louis King Johnson Jr. in the Eastside of Chicago, Illinois on December 27, 1987. He attended Hyde Park Academy High School for a while before graduating from alternative school.\n\nCareer \nAfter attending high school, King Louie began building a following through one-on-one mixtapes. He would hand out CDs at bus stops and parties. King Louie released his debut mixtape entitled Boss Shit in September 2007, and the next year released his second mixtape Cloud 9 in December 2009.\n\nHowever, his career was put on hold after he was hit by a car. He was hospitalized with both his legs broken with various other injuries and had to learn to walk again after his injuries were healed. He later returned to music, releasing a series of mixtapes that he made available online. Songs from his releases received regular air time, including his song \"Too Cool\" which was placed in regular rotation at WGCI-FM. To promote his mixtapes, King Louie launched a series of music videos on YouTube. His first video was for the song I'm Arrogant which was the lead track from his 2010 mixtape Man Up, Band Up. He released additional music videos and quickly grew a large following. It was his promotional methods on YouTube that helped him be one of the newer Chicago rappers to get noticed nationally.\n\nIn 2012, during a trip to Los Angeles, California, King Louie met and signed with Epic Records. While on his trip, Kanye West's record label GOOD Music released a remix of a song by Chicago hip-hop artist Chief Keef. During the release, West took  time to mention numerous other up and coming artists, including King L. King Louie was later quoted on MTV's Sucker Free program that he was shocked and not aware that West was a fan. He would later appear on West's Yeezus, performing a verse and the hook on the track \"Send It Up\". He was shot in the head in Chicago on December 23, 2015, and survived the shooting.\n\nDiscography\n\nMixtapes \n Boss Shit (2007)\n Cloud 9 (2008)\n Man Up Band Up (2010)\n More Boss Shit (2011)\n Chiraq Drillinois (2011)\n Hardbody The Mixtape with Bo$$ Who & Sno Boy (2011)\n #ManUpBandUp Pt.1 (2011)\n Man Up Band Up 2 (2011)\n The Motion Picture (2012)\n Showtime (2012)\n Drilluminati (2012)\n March Madness (2013)\n Jeep Music (2013)\n Drilluminati 2 (2013)\n Soprano (2014)\n Tony (2014)\n Drilluminati 3: God of Drill (2015)\n 6 God Tony (2015)\n Play Dat Again (2015)\n Featuring Tony (2016)\n Tony 2 (2016)\n Life With Louie (2022)\n\nGuest appearances\n\nSee also \n\n List of Epic Records artists\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\nLiving people\n1987 births\nAfrican-American male rappers\nAmerican male rappers\nDrill musicians\nGangsta rappers\nEpic Records artists\nMidwest hip hop musicians\nRappers from Chicago\nSongwriters from Illinois\n21st-century American rappers\n21st-century American male musicians\nAfrican-American songwriters\n21st-century African-American musicians\n20th-century African-American people\nAmerican male songwriters",

        "Andrée Mégard (born Marie Adélaïde Alexandrine Chamonal, 1869–1952), was a French actress and stage beauty.\n\nEarly life \nMarie Adélaïde Alexandrine Chamonal was born in 1869, in Saint-Amour, in the Jura Mountains. Her parents were \"well-off peasants\" who apprenticed her to an aunt who ran a dry good store; she ran away from the aunt at fifteen, and landed alone in Paris.\n\nCareer \n\nMégard worked as an artists' model as a young woman in Paris, especially for artist Auguste Toulmouche. She was on the Paris stage from 1896 to 1925, appearing in shows including Shakepearean tragedies, comedies, and plays directed by her husband, Firmin Gémier. She played the love interest, Roxane, in a 1913 revival of Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac, while she was having an affair with Rostand himself. She starred in a stage adaptation of Anna Karenina in Paris in 1907. In 1908 she knocked herself unconscious on stage during an emotional scene. She appeared in one silent film, La tour de Nesle (1909).\n\nMégard was considered \"tall, graceful, and distinguished looking.\" Her hairstyles and the designs of her costumes, hats, and gowns were reported in detail, internationally, often with photographs or drawings showing their features. She was especially known for wearing the creations of Redfern, the English design house. A New York writer in 1906 declared of the Paris theatre scene that \"Even the critics themselves, disdainful of the pieces they have had to comment upon, turn their clever pens to the question of clothes.\" \"Madame Mégard has for many years back been one of the recognized beauties of the French stage, and as such as earned more than one succés de jolie femme,\" commented a London writer in 1907, \"but it is only recently that her power as an actress has been fully realized.\"\n\nPersonal life \nAndrée Mégard married actor and director Firmin Gémier. She was an enthusiastic automobile driver by 1909; \"There is no more intrepid 'chauffeuse' on the white roads of France,\" noted one report, after she and her sister were injured in a motoring accident in Brittany. Mégard died in 1952.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n \n A sketch of Mégard by Albert de Belleroche, circa 1900.\n A hand-colored Reutlinger photograph of Mégard, from a 1906 publication, at Getty Images.\n A Reutlinger photograph of Mégard, from a 1908 publication, at Getty Images.\n A hand-colored Reutlinger photograph of Mégard, from a 1912 publication, at Getty Images.\n\n1869 births\n1952 deaths\nFrench actresses\nPeople from Jura (department)",

        "Annette Allcock  Rookledge, (28 November 1923 – 2 May 2001) was a British artist and illustrator.\n\nBiography\nAllcock was born in Bromley, Kent in November 1923. After a private education, she attended the West of England College of Art between 1941 and 1943. She subsequently attended other art schools on a part-time basis. After World War II ended, Allcock worked as a film animator producing cinema adverts and short pieces for the Ministry of Information. Influenced by Stanley Spencer, who was a distant relative and who she frequently visited at his home in Cookham, Allcock became a full-time artist and concentrated on painting portraits of children. After raising her own children, she returned to work by designing charity greeting cards from home. She also illustrated a number of children's books for the Methuen publishing house. Between 1978 and 1986, Allcock was a regular exhibitor at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibitions in London. Allcock also exhibited with the Royal West of England Academy and at the Beaux Arts Gallery in Bath and elsewhere in Britain. She died in Somerset in May 2001 at the age of 77.\n\nReferences\n\n1923 births\n2001 deaths\n20th-century English painters\n20th-century English women artists\nAlumni of the University of the West of England, Bristol\nEnglish children's book illustrators\nEnglish women painters\nPeople from Bromley",

        "Mitchell David Albom (born May 23, 1958) is an American author, journalist, and musician. As of 2021, books he'd authored had sold over 40 million copies worldwide. Having achieved national recognition for sports writing in his early career, he turned to writing inspirational stories and themes—a preeminent early one being Tuesdays with Morrie—themes that now weave their way through his books, plays, and films and stageplays.\n\nEarly life and education\nAlbom was born on May 23, 1958 in Passaic, New Jersey; he lived in Buffalo, New York for a little while until his family settled in Oaklyn, New Jersey, just outside of Philadelphia. He is of Jewish descent. \n\nAlbom earned a bachelor's degree in sociology in 1979 from Brandeis University, and after forays into music and journalism, returned to earn graduate master's degrees in journalism (at Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism), and business (from Columbia University Graduate School of Business), paying his tuition in part through employment playing piano.\n\nCareer\n\nAs a columnist\nWhile living in New York, Albom developed an interest in journalism. Still supporting himself by working nights in the music industry, he began to write during the day for the Queens Tribune, a weekly newspaper in Flushing, New York. His work there helped earn him entry into the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. To help pay his tuition he took work as a babysitter. In addition to nighttime piano playing,  Albom took a part-time job with SPORT magazine. After graduation he freelanced as a sportswriter for Sports Illustrated, GEO, and The Philadelphia Inquirer, and covered Olympic sports events in Europeincluding track and field and lugepaying his own way for travel, and selling articles once he was there. In 1983, he was hired as a full-time feature writer for The Fort Lauderdale News and Sun Sentinel, and eventually promoted to columnist. In 1985, having won that year's Associated Press Sports Editors award for best Sports News Story, Albom was hired as lead sports columnist for the Detroit Free Press to replace Mike Downey, a popular columnist who had taken a job with the Los Angeles Times.\n\nAlbom's sports column quickly became popular. In 1989, when the Detroit Free Press and the Detroit News merged weekend publications, Albom was asked to add a weekly non-sports column to his duties. That column ran on Sundays in the \"Comment\" section and dealt with American life and values. It was eventually syndicated across the country. Both columns continue in the Detroit Free Press.\n\nMany of his columns have been collected into anthology books including Live Albom I (Detroit Free Press, 1988), Live Albom II (Detroit Free Press, 1990), Live Albom III (Detroit Free Press, 1992), and Live Albom IV (Detroit Free Press, 1995).\n\nAlbom also serves as a contributing editor to Parade magazine. His column is syndicated by Tribune Content Agency.\n\nGame attendance error suspension\nIn 2005, Albom and four editors were briefly suspended from the Detroit Free Press after Albom wrote a column that stated that two college basketball players were in the crowd at an NCAA tournament game when in fact they were not. In a column printed in the April 3, 2005, edition, Albom described two former Michigan State basketball players, both then in the NBA, attending an NCAA Final Four semifinal game on Saturday to cheer for their school. The players had told Albom they planned to attend, so Albom, filing on his normal Friday deadline but knowing the column could not come out until Sunday (after the game was over) wrote that the players were there. But the players' plans changed at the last minute and they did not attend the game. The Detroit Free Press also suspended the four editors who had read the column and allowed it to go to print. Albom was in attendance at the game, but the columnist failed to check on the two players' presence. A later internal investigation found no other similar instances in Albom's past columns, but did cite an editorial-wide problem of routinely using unattributed quotes from other sources. Carol Leigh Hutton, publisher of the Detroit Free Press at the time of these events, later told Buzzfeed that she regretted the way it was handled. \"It was a stupid mistake that Mitch made that others failed to catch but not at all indicative of some problem that required the response we gave it. I allowed myself to believe that we were doing this highly credible, highly transparent thing, when really in hindsight what I think we were doing was acquiescing to people who were taking advantage of a stupid mistake.\"\n\nAs an author\n\nAs of 2021, Albom's books had sold over 40 million copies worldwide.\n\nSports volumes\nAlbom's first non-anthology book was Bo: Life, Laughs, and the Lessons of a College Football Legend (Warner Books), an autobiography of football coach Bo Schembechler co-written with the coach. The book was published in August 1989 and became Albom's first New York Times bestseller. Albom's next book was Fab Five: Basketball, Trash Talk, The American Dream, a look into the starters on the University of Michigan men's basketball team that reached the NCAA championship game as freshmen in 1992 and again as sophomores in 1993. The book was published in November 1993 and also became a New York Times bestseller.\n\nTuesdays with Morrie\n\nAlbom's breakthrough book came about after he was rotating the TV channels and viewed Morrie Schwartz's interview with Ted Koppel on ABC News Nightline in 1995, in which Schwartz, a sociology professor, spoke about living and dying with a terminal disease, ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease). Albom, who was close to Schwartz during his college years at Brandeis University, felt guilty about not keeping in touch so he reconnected with his former professor, visiting him in suburban Boston and eventually coming every Tuesday for discussions about life and death. Albom, seeking a way to pay for Schwartz's medical bills, sought out a publisher for a book about their visits. Although rejected by numerous publishing houses, Doubleday accepted the idea shortly before Schwartz's death, and Albom was able to fulfill his wish to pay Schwartz's bills.\n\nTuesdays with Morrie, which chronicled Albom's time spent with his professor, was published in 1997. The initial printing was 20,000 copies. As word of mouth grew, the book sales slowly increased and landed the book a brief appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, nudging the book onto the New York Times Best Seller list in October 1997. It steadily climbed reaching the number-one position six months later. It remained on the New York Times Best Seller list for 205 weeks. One of the top selling memoirs of all time, Tuesdays With Morrie has sold over 20 million copies and has been translated into 45 languages. On November 22, 2005, Albom was the sole and final guest on Ted Koppel's farewell appearance on ABC's Nightline. Koppel had gotten to know Albom through his broadcasts with Morrie Schwartz, and the final program dealt with the legacy of those shows and Albom's book.\n\nOprah Winfrey produced a television movie adaptation by the same name for ABC, starring Hank Azaria as Albom and Jack Lemmon as Morrie. It was the most-watched TV movie of 1999 and won four Emmy Awards. (In 2000, at the Emmy Awards, Albom was personally thanked by actor Jack Lemmon during his acceptance speech for his Emmy for Best Actor in a TV Movie or Miniseries for Tuesdays With Morrie, which would be Lemmon's last major acting role.)\n\nThe Five People You Meet in Heaven\n\nAfter the success of Tuesdays with Morrie, Albom's follow-up was the fiction book The Five People You Meet in Heaven (Hyperion Books) which he published in September 2003. It was a fast success and again launched Albom onto the New York Times best-seller list. The Five People You Meet in Heaven sold over 10 million copies in 38 territories and in 35 languages. In 2004, it became a television movie for ABC, starring Jon Voight, Ellen Burstyn, Michael Imperioli, and Jeff Daniels. Directed by Lloyd Kramer the film was critically acclaimed and the most watched TV movie of the year, with 18.7 million viewers.\n\nFor One More Day\n\nAlbom's second novel, For One More Day (Hyperion), was published in 2006. It is about Charley \"Chick\" Benetto, a retired baseball player who, facing the pain of unrealized dreams, alcoholism, divorce, and an estrangement from his grown daughter, returns to his childhood home and attempts suicide; there, he meets his long dead mother, who welcomes him as if nothing ever happened, and in this way, the book explores the question, \"What would you do if you had one more day with someone you've lost?\".\n\nThe hardcover edition of For One More Day spent nine months on the New York Times Best Seller list after debuting at the top spot, and reached No. 1 on the USA Today and Publishers Weekly bestseller lists. It has been translated into 26 languages. It was the first book to be sold by Starbucks in the launch of the Book Break Program in the fall of 2006.\n\nOn December 9, 2007, ABC television aired the 2-hour television event motion picture Oprah Winfrey Presents: Mitch Albom's For One More Day, which starred Michael Imperioli and Ellen Burstyn. Burstyn received a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for her performance in the role of Posey Benetto. Albom has said his relationship with his own mother was largely behind the story of that book, and that several incidents in For One More Day are actual events from his childhood.\n\nHave a Little Faith\n\nHave a Little Faith, Albom's first nonfiction book since Tuesdays With Morrie, was released on September 29, 2009, through Hyperion publishing, and recounts Albom's experiences that led to him writing the eulogy for Albert L. Lewis, a rabbi from his hometown in New Jersey. The book is written in the same vein as Tuesdays With Morrie, in which the main character, Mitch, goes through several heartfelt conversations with the Rabbi in order to better know and understand the man that he would one day eulogize. Through this experience, Albom writes, his own sense of faith was reawakened leading him to make contact with Henry Covington, the African-American pastor of the I Am My Brother's Keeper church in Detroit, where Albom was then living. Covington, a past drug addict, dealer, and ex-convict, ministered to a congregation of largely homeless men and women in a church so poor that the roof leaked when it rained. From his relationships with these two very different men of faith, Albom writes about the difference faith can make in the world.\n\nOn November 27, 2011, ABC aired the Hallmark Hall of Fame television movie based on the book.\n\nThe Time Keeper\n\nThe book focuses on the inventor of the world's first clock, Father Time, who Albom presents as being punished for trying to measure God's greatest gift. He is banished to a cave for centuries and forced to listen to the voices of all who came after him seeking more days and years; eventually, his soul nearly broken, Father Time is granted his freedom along with a magical hourglass and a mission: a chance to redeem himself by teaching two earthly people the true meaning of time. He returns to our world, now dominated by the hour and commences a journey with two unlikely partners: a teenage girl who is about to give up on life, and a wealthy old businessman who wants to live forever, and to save himself, he must save them.\n\nThe First Phone Call from Heaven\nIn 2013, Albom moved to a new publisher, HarperCollins, for the publication of his seventh book and fourth novel. In The First Phone Call From Heaven, the small town of Coldwater, Michigan, is thrust into the international spotlight when its citizens suddenly start receiving phone calls from deceased loved ones. Is it the greatest miracle ever or a massive hoax? Sully Harding, a grief-stricken single father recently released from prison, is determined to find the truth. The town is fictional and not the real Coldwater, Michigan, but Albom pays tribute to the real small town in the book's acknowledgements. The First Phone Call from Heaven received starred reviews from Publishers Weekly and Library Journal.\n\nThe Magic Strings of Frankie Presto\n\nAlbom's fifth novel, The Magic Strings of Frankie Presto, was published by HarperCollins in 2015. His longest book at almost 400 pages, it chronicles the life and mysterious death of the fictional musician Frankie Presto, as narrated by the voice of Music. An orphan born in a burning church in Spain in 1936, Frankie is blessed with musical ability: at nine years old, Frankie is sent to America in the bottom of a boat, his only possession is an old guitar and six precious strings. The Forrest Gump-like journey that follows takes him through the musical landscape of the 20th century, from classical to jazz to rock and roll super stardom, meeting and working with musical greats (like Hank Williams, Elvis Presley, Carole King, Little Richard, and The Beatles). Real musicians including Tony Bennett, Wynton Marsalis, Paul Stanley, Darlene Love, and Ingrid Michaelson, lent their names to first-person passages to the book, and an original 17-song soundtrack for the book was released by Republic Records four days before the book's release. It featured original songs written and performed by Albom and other artists including Sawyer Fredericks, Mat Kearney, Ingrid Michaelson, John Pizzarelli, and James Brent, interpreting Frankie Presto's \"greatest hits\", along with such older favorites featured in the novel such as Tony Bennett's \"Lost in the Stars\" and Dionne Warwick's \"A House is Not a Home.\"\n\nThe Next Person You Meet in Heaven\nA sequel to The Five People You Meet in Heaven, Albom's novel The Next Person You Meet in Heaven tells the story of Eddie's heavenly reunion with Annie, the little girl he saved on earth in the first book. The story strongly emphasizes on how lives and losses intersect, and that not only does every life matter, but that every ending is also a new beginning. The book debuted at the top of the New York Times Best Seller list.\n\nFinding Chika\n\nThis book marked Albom's return to nonfiction for the first time in a decade. It is a memoir and a tribute to Chika, a young Haitian orphan who arrived at Albom's Have Faith Haiti Orphanage in Port Au Prince before being diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumor and dying two years later.\n\nAn excerpt was read by Albom on the new Lit Hub/Podglomerate Storybound (podcast), accompanied by an original score from musician Maiah Wynne.\n\nThe Stranger in the Lifeboat\n\nAlbom's seventh novel, The Stranger in the Lifeboat was published on November 2, 2021 in the US by Harper, an imprint of Harpercollins, and by Sphere, an imprint of Little, Brown Book Group in the UK. The book became a #1 New York Times Best Seller in its first week of sales.\n\nAs radio host\n\nAlbom began on radio in 1987 on WLLZ-Detroit, a now-defunct Active Rock radio station. He worked on the station's morning program as a sports commentator, and started a Sunday night sports-talk program, The Sunday Sports Albom in 1988, believed to be one of the first sports talks shows to ever air on FM radio.\n\nIn 1996, he moved to WJR, a powerful,  clear-channel station in Detroit where he broadcasts a five-day a week general talk show with an emphasis on entertainment, writing, current events and culture. He has been honored by the Michigan Association of Broadcasters as the top afternoon talk show host, and was voted best talk show host in Detroit by Hour Detroit magazine. In 2001, the show was televised nationally in a simulcast by MSNBC. Albom continues to do the show from 5 to 7 p.m. ET. After his Monday show, he hosts an hour-long sports talk show called, \"The Monday Sports Albom\".\n\nAs playwright\nOn November 19, 2002, the stage version of Tuesdays with Morrie opened Off Broadway at the Minetta Lane Theatre. Co-authored by Mitch Albom and Jeffrey Hatcher (Three Viewings) and directed by David Esbjornson (The Goat or Who Is Sylvia?). Tuesdays with Morrie starred Alvin Epstein (original Lucky in Waiting for Godot) as Morrie and Jon Tenney (The Heiress) as Mitch.\n\nHis follow-up to the stage adaptation of Tuesdays were two original comedies that premiered at the Purple Rose Theatre Company in Chelsea, Michigan, started by actor Jeff Daniels. Duck Hunter Shoots Angel (The Purple Rose's highest grossing play as of 2008) and And the Winner Is have both been produced nationwide, the latter having its West Coast premiere at the Laguna Playhouse in Laguna Beach, California.\n\nThe premiere of Albom's Ernie, a play dedicated to the memory of famed Detroit Tigers broadcaster Ernie Harwell, occurred in April 2011 at the City Theatre in Detroit. In subsequent years the play travelled to theaters in Traverse City, East Lansing, and Grand Rapids. It has run for seven summer seasons as of 2017.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, Albom debuted his first musical at the City Theatre with \"HockeyThe Musical!\" A musical comedy with a book, original songs and parody lyrics written by Albom, \"HockeyThe Musical!\" follows five characters who work to convince God to spare hockey after concluding that the world has too many sports and one should be eliminated. An opening night review in The Detroit Free Press describe an \"audience roaring for most of the 90 minutes\"\n\nAs musician\nAlbom is an accomplished songwriter, pianist and lyricist. In 1992, he wrote the song \"Cookin' For Two\" for a television movie, Christmas in Connecticut, directed by Arnold Schwarzenegger. The song was nominated for The CableACE Award. Albom has been featured on the cover of Making Music Magazine. He also co-wrote the song \"Hit Somebody (The Hockey Song)\", which was recorded by singer/songwriter Warren Zevon with David Letterman on backup vocals. The song was released as a single in Canada and will be adapted into a film by director Kevin Smith. He performed with the Rock Bottom Remainders, a band of writers that also featured Dave Barry, Stephen King, Ridley Pearson, Amy Tan, Kathi Kamen Goldmark, Sam Barry, and Scott Turow from 1995 until the band dissolved in 2012 with the death of founder Kathi Goldmark. Their performances raised funds for various children's literacy projects across the country.\n\nIn July 2013, Albom co-authored Hard Listening (Coliloquy, 2013) with the rest of the Rock Bottom Remainders.  The ebook combines essays, fiction, musings, candid email exchanges, and conversations, compromising photographs, audio, and video clips, and interactive quizzes to give readers a view into the private lives of the authors.\n\nTelevision appearances\n\nAlbom appeared regularly on ESPN's The Sports Reporters (aired Sunday mornings from Studio A in Bristol, Connecticut at ESPN Plaza at 9:00am EST) and regularly appears on SportsCenter. He has also made appearances on Costas Now, The Oprah Winfrey Show, The Today Show, CBS's The Early Show, ABC's Good Morning America, Dr. Phil, Larry King Live, The View, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. He also appeared as a guest voice on The Simpsons on the episode Thursdays with Abie in 2010.\n\nCharity work\n\"The Dream Fund\", established in 1989, provides a scholarship for disadvantaged children to study the arts. \"A Time to Help\" which started in 1998, is a Detroit volunteer group. \"S.A.Y. (Super All Year) Detroit\" is an umbrella program that funds shelters and cares for the homeless. It is now a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that funds numerous homeless shelters throughout the Metro Detroit area.\n\nIn 1999, Albom was named National Hospice Organization's Man of the Year.\n\nHis most recent effort, A Hole in the Roof Foundation, helps faith groups of different denominations who care for the homeless repair the spaces they use. Their first project was the I Am My Brother's Keeper roof in the crumbling but vibrant Detroit church, completed in December 2009. The second project, completed in April 2010, was the rebuilding of the Caring and Sharing Mission and Orphanage. It is now called the Have Faith Haiti Mission & Orphanage, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.\n\nAlbom also directs the Have Faith Haiti Mission, a project whose stated objective is \"dedicated to the safety, education, health and spiritual development of Haiti's impoverished children and orphans\", incorporating language lessons and Christian prayer.\n\nOther activities\n\nDuring the Detroit newspaper strike of 1995–1997, Albom crossed the picket line and returned to work.\n\nIn February 2003, Albom was called to testify at the perjury trial of Chris Webber, member of the \"Fab Five\" of the University of Michigan's basketball teams in the early 1990s, and subject of a book by Albom. Webber and three others players—the remainder of \"Fab Five\" were not implicated—were alleged to have received over $290,000 in improper loans from a man considered to be a booster of the University of Michigan, although the amounts were never verified.  The loans were allegedly made to players and their families (the school being without alleged involvement or knowledge).\n\nOn October 22, 2007, Albom appeared with former New York Governor Mario Cuomo and Tony Bennett in An Evening with Tony Bennett, to honor the release of Bennett's Tony Bennett In The Studio: A Life of Art and Music, for which Albom wrote the foreword.\n\nAwards and recognition\n\nDuring Albom's years in Detroit, he became one of the most awarded sports writers of his era: He was named best sports columnist in the nation a record 13 times by the Associated Press Sports Editors, and won best feature writing honors from the AP a record seven times. As of that date, no other writer has received the award more than once. Albom has won more than 200 other writing honors, from organizations including the National Headliner Awards, the American Society of Newspaper Editors, the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association, and National Association of Black Journalists.\n\nOn June 25, 2010, Albom was awarded the APSE's Red Smith Award for lifetime achievement, presented at the annual APSE convention in Salt Lake City, Utah, although his selection was heavily criticized by a number of Albom's peers, including fellow Red Smith Award winner Dave Kindred.\n\nIn 2013, Albom was inducted into the National Sports Media Association (NSMA) \"Hall of Fame\", (formerly the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association). Albom's induction into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame was announced May 2017.\n\nPersonal life\n \nAlbom has been married to his wife, Janine, since 1995, and they reside in Detroit, Michigan. \n\nAlbom and his wife adopted an orphan named Chika Jeune, who came to his attention as a result of his work with his Haitian orphanage. The child was diagnosed with a brain tumor and died after a two-year battle, at age 7, in 2017. His 2019 book, Finding Chika, was about the experiences with her.\n\nSelected books\nLive Albom: The Best of Detroit Free Press Sports Columnist Mitch Albom (1988) \nLive Albom II (1990) \nLive Albom III: Gone to the Dogs (1992) \nFab Five: Basketball, Trash Talk, the American Dream (1993)  \nLive Albom IV (1995), foreword by Dave Barry \nTuesdays with Morrie (August 1997) \nThe Five People You Meet in Heaven (September 2003) \nFor One More Day (September 2006) \nHave a Little Faith: A True Story (September 2009) \nThe Time Keeper (September 2012) \nThe Magic Strings of Frankie Presto (November 2012) \nThe First Phone Call from Heaven (November 2013) \nThe Next Person You Meet in Heaven (October 2018) \nFinding Chika: A Little Girl, an Earthquake, and the Making of a Family (November 2019) \nHuman Touch: A Story in Real Time (April 2020) (available for free on Albom's website, with donations going toward SAY Detroit's \"Detroit Beats COVID-19\")\nThe Stranger in the Lifeboat (November 2021) \nThe Little Liar (November 2023)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n  An image of Mitch Alblom and Janine Sabino at the opening of Tuesdays with Morrie, off Broadway.

        "Polkacide was a band based in the San Francisco Bay Area that played \"punk polka\".\n\nBand history \nPolkacide was founded in 1985 by Ward Abronski, originally organized to play a one-time show for the 50th anniversary of the Deaf Club in San Francisco. None of the 12 original members were polka musicians at the time, but they had varied backgrounds in classical, rock, punk and jazz music. Clarinetist Neil Kaitner came up with the name for the band and also designed the band logo, which features a skull and crossed sausages. One week before the performance was to take place, it was cancelled due to noise abatement orders from local authorities. Rather than not be able to play, the band decided to play at least one performance in a punk show at the Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco.\n\nThe band subsequently appeared on the Doctor Demento television show and made several recordings. After 32 years together, they played a farewell concert on 8 October 2017, entitled \"The Last Polka\".\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\nPunk rock groups from California\nMusical groups from San Francisco",

        "John Ely (September 24, 1737 – October 3, 1800) was a Connecticut surgeon and Colonel in the American Revolution.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in Lyme, Connecticut, John Ely became a physician and surgeon with a reputation that reached far beyond the Saybrook He specialized in the treatment of smallpox. He bought Duck Island off the Saybrook shore (now a major Egret rookery) and then built a hospital for his smallpox patients. When this disease broke out in the Army of General George Washington in July 1776, Dr. Ely was sent for and did much to arrest the plague.\n\nRevolutionary War\n\nColonel Ely is remembered as a soldier of the American Revolution and as a patriot who gave not only his skill as physician and military commander to the cause, but his fortune and his health. \n\nHe was a Captain of the Sixth Connecticut from May 1 to December 18, 1775; Colonel of a Connecticut militia regiment in 1777; he was taken prisoner in the Long Island Expedition of December 10, 1777; and exchanged on December 5, 1780.\n\nIn 1775 John Ely purchased Duck Island from John Williams. He obtained permission to operate a hospital was granted annually by the selectmen of Old Saybrook. By 1780 the brothers had parted, and Doctor Elisha Ely secured permission to open.\n\nThe British burned Ely's hospital during the Revolutionary War.\n\nIn 1775 Ely, after the news of the battle of Lexington came to Westport, mustered a company of militia as Captain and marched with it to Roxbury, now part of Boston. The next year as Major he performed a tour of duty as commandant at Fort Trumbull, New London, also serving there as physician and one day he sent a \"pithy\" letter to the Captain of a vessel at the mouth of the harbor suspected of being English which promptly sailed away.\n\nIn 1776, he was ordered by Connecticut to tend to the medical needs of soldiers.\n\nMajor Ely was a man of wealth, mostly invested in farms. One of these in 1777 he sold and used most of the proceeds in raising a regiment of which he was commissioned Colonel. To many of his men he furnished arms, uniforms, and other supplies at his own expense.\n\nHe marched his regiment to New London and was again appointed commandant of the Fort.\n\nAfter he became a prisoner, his son Capt. Worthington Ely organized a small force to capture a British officer to exchange for his father. In this he was successful. But due to the entreaties of the other officer prisoners, Dr. Ely agreed to remain a prisoner to care for his fellow officers. Sometime after this, when he became eligible for exchange, a group of former prisoner officers under the leadership of Col. Matthews (later a member of Congress and Governor of Georgia) and Col. Ramsay of the Maryland line, urged him to continue caring for his fellow prisoners. Thus Dr. Ely remained a prisoner for three years, until finally released on 25 December 1780.  Ely was one of the most famous doctors of his era, particularly for treating soldiers who were afflicted by Smallpox.  After he was captured by the British, he refused to be exchanged, because he did not want to leave his patients.\n\nHe was released as part of a prisoner exchange on December 5, 1780.\n\nPost Revolution\n\nAfter the war, Col. Ely applied to Congress for recompense for his services and for the money he had devoted to the revolution. General Henry Knox, Secretary of War, supported this and President Washington wrote the Colonel promising a successful outcome for his petition. The House adopted a bill to grant him $20,000.00. But U.S. Senator Oliver Ellsworth opposed money grants and successfully fought the Ely measure in the Senate. Some forty years later his heirs presented a claim to Congress, which was approved, but as most of the papers in the case had been lost, only $5,000.00 of back pay was allowed.\n\nEly wrote repeatedly to George Washington seeking his assistance.\n\nAfter his release from Long Island, he returned to Westbrook where he resumed his medical practice.\n\nEly died in Westbrook, CT on October 3, 1800, aged 63. He is buried in the Old Burying Ground in Westbrook next to the gravestone of his father-in-law, the Rev. William Worthington.  His entreaties to Washington were fruitless during his lifetime, and he died impoverished.\n\nAmong his friends he numbered Washington, Lafayette, and Rochambeau. Mrs. Ely was able to speak in their native tongue to the French officers she entertained. Washington wrote the Colonel affectionate letters acknowledging his \"incomparable services.\" He was invited to dinner by General Benedict Arnold, before the latter betrayed his country: \"General Arnold's compliments wait on Col. Ely. He asks the favor of his company to dine with him at his house today at 2 o'clock.\"\n\nNotable descendants\nJohn Ely's grandson Samuel Griswold Goodrich, also known as Peter Parley, was a noted author and diplomat whose book Recollections of a Lifetime was the source for the information herein not otherwise cited.\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\nFurther reading\n Caulkins, Frances Manwaring (1852) History of New London, Connecticut (New London, Connecticut: Francis Manwaring Caulkins), p. 521\n\n The History of the Ely Re-union held at Lyme, Conn., July 10th, 1878, 1879 (New York: Styles & Cash), p. 60\n Year Book (1896).

        "Sweet Sorrow () is a South Korean male vocal group formed in 2002. Originally a quartet, its current members consist of In Ho-jin, Song Woo-jin and Kim Young-woo. In 2019, they joined with female vocal group The Barberettes and performed together under the name \"SBSB\" (Hangul: 스바스바).\n\nHistory\nIn Ho-jin, Song Woo-jin, Sung Jin-hwan and pianist Kim Young-woo first met around 1996 as students at Yonsei University and were all members of the university glee club. Together with four other friends, they formed their own eight-member a cappella group and received a positive response. The name \"Sweet Sorrow\" was taken from the quote \"Parting is such sweet sorrow\" in Romeo and Juliet and was conceived by Kim, an English literature major, as a reminder of the hardship they had gone through together. Only the four of them chose to pursue music professionally and debuted in 2002.\n\nAfter a stint performing cover songs at college festivals and events, the quartet came to national prominence by winning the Daesang (Grand Prize) at the 16th Yoo Jae-ha Music Competition for their original song \"Sweet Sorrow\". They were signed by the company Mezoo Cultures and released their first album in 2005. They also came to prominence with a much larger audience for performing the soundtracks of popular television dramas and their appearances on the MBC singing competition Show Survival (쇼바이벌) and the KBS music program Immortal Songs: Singing the Legend. \n\nIn December 2017, Sung announced that he would be a hiatus due to health reasons and later left permanently. Sweet Sorrow returned as a trio in 2019 with a new album. They also combined with The Barberettes to form a mixed group called \"SBSB\" and performed together on Immortal Songs.\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nExtended plays\n\nSingles\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nA cappella musical groups\nSouth Korean boy bands\nSouth Korean pop music groups\nSouth Korean contemporary R&B musical groups\nYonsei University alumni",

        "Sir William Thomas White, GCMG, PC (UK), PC (Can) (November 13, 1866February 11, 1955), was a Canadian politician and Cabinet minister. He served as minister of finance from 1911 to 1919 under Prime Minister Robert Borden. As finance minister, White introduced the income tax to help fund Canada's World War I efforts.\n\nEarly life \n\nWhite worked as a reporter for the Toronto Evening Telegram in 1890, and subsequently worked for Toronto's Assessment Department. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Toronto in 1895, and a law degree from Osgoode Law School in 1899.  \n\nWhite did not practice law after his graduation, but instead worked as a Managing Director for the National Trust Company, Ltd., becoming its Vice-President in 1911. National Trust was incorporated in 1898 by Senator George Albertus Cox and Edward Rogers Wood. National Trust Company, Ltd. became part of Bank of Nova Scotia as Scotia Trust in 1997.\n\nPolitical career and finance minister \n\nWhite was initially a Liberal party member, but his views diverged from the party's policies on some key matters. He was a supporter of British imperialism, and joined Clifford Sifton and other Liberals in signing an anti - reciprocity manifesto in 1911.\n\nAlthough he had few allies in the Conservative Party, White was respected by party leader Robert Borden, who recognized that White's presence would bring some disaffected Liberals to the party. After winning the general election of 1911, Borden appointed White as his Minister of Finance.  White did not hold a seat in the House of Commons of Canada at the time, and in fact had never campaigned for public office before.  Nevertheless, he was elected by acclamation in a by-election in the eastern Ontario riding of Leeds, after another Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) was convinced to resign.\n\nWhite was responsible for managing Canada's finances during World War I.  His approach was conservative, and he was reluctant to interfere with private enterprise or even to raise taxes in the early period of the war.  Although he eventually made some interventions (including fixed profit margins and regulated food supplies), he continued to reject fundamental changes in the nation's finances. One exception was the introduction in 1917 of an income tax of 4% on all income of single men over $2,000; for Canadians with annual incomes of more than $6,000, the tax rate ranged from 2 to 25 per cent. Though it was intended as a temporary war measure and despite White's recommendation that \"a year or two after the war is over, the measure should be reviewed by the minister of finance of the day, with a view of judging whether it is suitable to the conditions which then prevail,\" income tax became a permanent feature of Canadian life.\n\nIn 1919, he approved the use of naval warships to suppress post-war labour radicalism in British Columbia. White served as Finance Minister until August 1, 1919. From November 1918 to May 1919, he also served as Acting Prime Minister while Borden was in Europe.  Several members of Borden's Unionist government (a wartime coalition of the Conservative Party and some Liberals) called on White to replace Borden as Prime Minister in 1920, but he declined.\n\nIn the 1920 New Year Honours, as a reward for his service as Acting Prime Minister, White was appointed to the Imperial Privy Council, allowing him to use the honorific \"The Right Honourable\". He remained a Member of Parliament until the 1921 election when he retired from politics.  Later in the year, he published a pamphlet entitled The Story of Canada's War Finances, defending his management of the wartime economy.\n\nLater life \n\nWhite did not consider himself as a \"career politician\". His tenure as Finance Minister was very stressful, and he seems to have welcomed the opportunity to leave political life after the war's end. There is no indication that he entertained a return to politics in later years.\n\nIn 1933, he served as a member of the Royal Commission on Banking and Currency. He opposed the creation of the Bank of Canada.\n\nArchives \nThere is a Sir William Thomas White fonds at Library and Archives Canada.\n\nFootnotes\n\nExternal links \n \n\n1866 births\n1955 deaths\nCanadian Ministers of Finance\nConservative Party of Canada (1867–1942) MPs\nCanadian Knights Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George\nMembers of the House of Commons of Canada from Ontario\nCanadian members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom\nMembers of the King's Privy Council for Canada\nLawyers in Ontario\nUniversity of Toronto alumni",

        "Arthur Augustus Allen (28 December 1885 – 17 January 1964) was an American professor of ornithology at Cornell University.\n\nAllen was born in Buffalo, New York, the son of Daniel Williams Allen and Anna née Moore. He studied at Cornell University, where he obtained his Bachelor of Arts in 1907, his Master of Arts in 1908 and his Ph.D. in 1911. His thesis is entitled \"The Red-Winged Blackbird: A Study in the Ecology of a Cattail Marsh\".\n\nFrom 1911 to 1912 he went on an expedition to Colombia, and from 1912 to 1916, he was appointed an instructor in zoology at Cornell. Former stockbroker Albert R. Brand was one of his graduate students. Brand collaborated with Cornell's engineering department to record bird songs, publishing two books accompanied by photographs.\n\nHe became an assistant professor in 1916, and a professor in 1926. Arthur continued his career at Cornell until his retirement in 1953. After his retirement, he was a public lecturer for the National Audubon Society from 1953 to 1959. It has been estimated that over 10,000 students took his courses, including over 100 doctoral students, at a time when Cornell was the only institution to offer advanced degrees in ornithology. Through his work, Allen introduced the field of ornithology to generations of professionals and amateurs.\n\nIn 1935 Allen led an expedition to the Singer Tract in Louisiana to search for ivory-billed woodpeckers. They did discover some, in what was to turn out to be the last documented, definite sighting, including photographs and audio. In the early 2000s there was a flurry of excitement at possible sightings in the same region, but controversy surrounds how sure the sightings were.\n\nAllen published an ornithological history in 1933 under the title Fifty Years' Progress of American Ornithology, 1883–1933. He was dedicated to promoting the study of birds to a wide audience, in his books, films and public lectures. His Book of Bird Life (1930, reissued in 1961) was a well-written introduction to ornithology for its time. He also conducted pioneering studies on recording bird songs in 1929 which led to the first record on the phonograph of bird songs in 1932. He worked on what eventually became the independent Cornell Lab of Ornithology in 1955, and founded the Wildlife Society in 1936, leading the organization from 1938 to 1939.\n\nPersonal life\nAllen married Elsa Guerdrum in 1913. They had five children. His wife also received a doctorate at Cornell and pursued a successful career as a historian of ornithology.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n1885 births\n1964 deaths\nAmerican ornithologists\nScientists from Buffalo, New York\nScientists from Ithaca, New York\nCornell University alumni\nCornell University faculty\n20th-century American zoologists",

        "Brauerei Paderborner is a brewery in the German city of Paderborn. The traditional Westphalian brewery was purchased by the German brewery-major Warsteiner in 1990.\n\nThe Paderborner beer range\nThe Paderborner brewery was founded in 1852. Since 1990 it has been part of the Warsteiner brewery group.\n\nThere are two different sorts of Paderborner. The first is simply called \"Paderborner Pilsener\" and has a rather herbal taste with an unusual sweetness which is actually hops. Paderborner Pilsener Export has a reputation for being of lower quality but also a compromise between price and amount of alcohol (since it has a barely larger amount of alcohol).\n\nThe second type is called Paderborner Gold and has a much fresher taste. It is a more recent variety than the original Paderborner Pilsener which has been brewed in this area for over 100 years. It was developed when the big Warsteiner company bought the small local brewery of Paderborn.\n\nPaderborner Gold is the favoured beer for all official festivities in the area.\n\nThe Paderborner brewery also offers mixed beers, namely with Cola and Lemon.\n\nAn attempt to copy the famous \"Alt\" beer (famous from Düsseldorf) was also made in 2008, named \"Paderborner Alt\"\n\nThe city of Paderborn is home to a great many festivals, including the Schützenfest (\"shooting club festival\") and the Libori festival.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nPaderborner Brauerei \n\nGerman companies established in 1852\nBreweries in Germany\nPaderborn",

        "The National University of Equatorial Guinea (UNGE, Universidad Nacional de Guinea Ecuatorial in Spanish) is a public institution of higher education, being one of the main universities of Equatorial Guinea in Central Africa.\n\nIt has a main campus in Malabo as well as a unit in Bata. Its current Rector is Filiberto Ntutumu Nguema Nchama.\n\nHistoric \n\nThe university tradition of UNGE dates back to the Spanish colonial period, when the country's first high schools were founded, anchored in the Spanish concern before the various decolonization movements that were beginning to take shape on the African continent.\n\nFrom the colonial period to independence \nThe course of the UNGE began with the former Indigenous Colonial Institute (in Spanish: Instituto Colonial Indígena), created on March 30, 1935, with vocation for technical education. However, it was only on August 6, 1943, when this Institute was elevated to Indigenous Higher School (ESI; in Spanish: Escuela Superior Indígena), that in fact began higher education in Guinea. From 1958 onwards, the ESI was renamed the Santo Tomás de Aquino Higher School (in Spanish: Escuela Superior Santo Tomás de Aquino), again changing its name in 1959 to the Provincial Higher School (in Spanish: Escuela Superior Provincial). In this period the establishment existed diplomas of administration, teaching (today pedagogy) and commerce (now economic sciences).\n\nWhile the country became independent, under the command of the dictator Macías Nguema, the school was reformulated, being denominated in 1971 of \nMartin Luther King Higher School (ESMLK; in Spanish: Escuela Superior \"Martin Luther King\"). The school, however, had not yet been able to fulfill a broad training role, a fact that would only occur in the 1980s, with the unification of the ESMLK with the School of Teaching of Malabo, allowing mainly to expand the training of graduates to teach at primary levels and secondary.\n\nPost-coup reforms by Obiang \n\nWhen Teodoro Obiang took over the government in a coup in 1979, he sought to expand access to higher education through strong cooperation with UNESCO and the Spanish government. This culminated in the transformation of ESMLK, in 1984, in University School of Training of the Teachers of Malabo (in Spanish: Escuela Universitaria de Formación del Profesorado de Malabo). In addition, the National School of Agriculture (later the University School of Agricultural, Fisheries and Forestry) was created in 1987, with financing from the African Development Bank. The educational reforms proposed by UNESCO to Obiang also gave origin to the University School of Training of the Professors of Bata and to University School of Health and Environment.\n\nFormation of UNGE \n\nThese four schools gave the possibility of maturing higher education to the country, while forming important technical staff. Faced with this the government saw the need to implement a university that would come to federate the institutions.\n\nThe National University of Equatorial Guinea (UNGE; in Spanish: Universidad Nacional de Guinea Ecuatorial) was created through Law No. 12/1995 of January 6, 1995, bringing together:\n\nUniversity School of Teacher Training of Malabo;\nUniversity School of Agricultural, Fisheries and Forest Studies;\nUniversity School of Teacher Training of Bata;\nUniversity School of Health and Environment.\n\nIn 1998 the University School of Administration was incorporated into the structure of UNGE and the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences was created. In 2001 was created the Faculty of Medical Sciences and the University School of Engineering and Technique.\n\nOrganisational structure \n\nIn 2015 the university was organized according to the following organizational structure:\n\nFaculty of Environment;\nFaculty of Arts and Social Sciences;\nFaculty of Education Sciences of Malabo;\nFaculty of Educational Sciences of Bata;\nFaculty of Architecture and Engineering of Bata;\nMedical Sciences College;\nFaculty of Humanities and Religious Sciences.\n\nThe UNGE is still composed of 3 affiliated university schools:\n\nUniversity School of Agricultural, Fisheries and Forest Studies \"Obiang Nguema Mbasogo\" (Faculty of Engineering of Malabo);\nUniversity School of Administration;\nUniversity School of Health and Environment.\n\nInfrastructure \nThe Main Campus in Malabo is located on Hassan II Avenue. The headquarters building of the rectory was built in 1949 and is part of the nation's architectural patrimony. The Malabo campus residence has a capacity of 200 seats.\n\nThe university has a rectory headquarters in Bata.\n\nThe university is still one of the responsible for the Luba Crater Scientific Reserve, developing many research projects there, mainly on the local primate population.\n\nRectors\n\nSee also\n Colegio Nacional Enrique Nvó Okenve\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nUniversidad Nacional de Guinea Ecuatorial (Spanish)\n\nEducational institutions established in 1995\nUniversities and colleges in Equatorial Guinea\nBuildings and structures in Malabo\nBata, Equatorial Guinea\nNational universities\n1995 establishments in Equatorial Guinea",

        "Panagiotis Nikoloudis (; born 1949) is a Greek prosecutor who served as the Minister of State for Combatting Corruption in the Caretaker Cabinet of Vassiliki Thanou-Christophilou and the Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras.\n\nProfessional career\n\nHe had been deputy prosecutor-general of the Greek Supreme Court and chairman of the Finance Intelligence Unit, a watchdog responsible for investigating financial crimes.\n\nIn February 2012, Nikoloudis revealed that one Member of the Hellenic Parliament (MP) had deposited one million Euros abroad in May 2011. In a session of the parliamentary Committee for Institutions and Transparency, he said, \"To take your money abroad is not a sin, it is not illegal in the formal sense of the law, but for me it is indicative.\" In response, the Deputy Prime Minister, Evangelos Venizelos, revealed that the Ministry of Finance had found a number of instances of MPs sending money abroad in 2011 and had asked for the Finance Intelligence Unit's help on a number of these cases.\n\nPolitical career\n\nOn 27 January 2015, Nikoloudis was appointed as Minister of State for Combatting Corruption in Alexis Tsipras' cabinet. Shortly after taking on the role, in February 2015, he said that he was targeting a \"handful of families who think that the state and public service exists to service their own interests.\" However, in an interview, he elaborated that he was not just targeting the rich in general as \"I would be crazy to think like that.\"\n\nIn March 2015, it was announced that Nikoloudis was investigating 80,000 wealthy Greeks who were suspected of having at least 200,000 Euros each in undeclared funds in bank accounts abroad. Speaking to The Times, he said: \"I'm not concerned about the so-called Lagarde list.

        "Enríquez de Valderrábano (c. 1500 – after 1557) was a Spanish vihuelist and composer. There is little biographical data on this composer of early music, but his Libro de música de vihuela intitulado Silva de Sirenas, published in Valladolid, Spain, in 1547, states he is a citizen of Peñaranda de Duero, and the book is dedicated to Francisco de Zúñiga, the Fourth Count of Miranda. This dedication is probably the source of Juan Bermudo's unconfirmed assertion in his Declaración de instrumentos musicales of 1555 that Valderrábano was employed by the count.\n\nValderrábano's book of music has seven parts containing fugas, contrapuntos, sonetos, bajas, vacas, discantes, pavanas, proverbios, canciones, romances, and villancicos—ordered by level of difficulty. It includes pieces for two vihuelas, for vihuela and another instrument, and for vihuela and voice.\n\nValderrábano's book is considered an important source of knowledge on the vihuela music of the Spanish Renaissance of the sixteenth century and European instrumental music in general, as it includes transcriptions of pieces by other significant composers of the time, including Cristóbal de Morales, Josquin des Prez, Nicolas Gombert, Philippe Verdelot, Jorge Báez de Sepúlveda, Adrian Willaert, Vincenzo Ruffo, Diego Ortiz, Juan Vásquez, and Jean Mouton.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1500s births\n16th-century deaths\nRenaissance composers\nSpanish classical composers\nSpanish male classical composers\nSpanish guitarists\nSpanish male guitarists\nVihuela players",

        "NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin-3, mitochondrial also known as SIRT3 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the SIRT3 gene [sirtuin (silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog) 3 (S. cerevisiae)]. SIRT3 is member of the mammalian sirtuin family of proteins, which are homologs to the yeast Sir2 protein. SIRT3  exhibits NAD+-dependent deacetylase activity.\n\nMembers of the sirtuin family are characterized by a sirtuin core domain and grouped into four classes, and the protein encoded by this gene is included in class I of the sirtuin family. The human sirtuins have a range of molecular functions and have emerged as important proteins in aging, stress resistance, and metabolic regulation. Yeast sirtuin proteins are known to regulate epigenetic gene silencing and suppress recombination of rDNA. In addition to protein deacetylation, studies have shown that the human sirtuins may also function as intracellular regulatory proteins with mono ADP ribosyltransferase activity.\n\nStructure \n\nSIRT3 is a soluble protein located in the mitochondrial matrix, and contains a mitochondrial processing peptide at the N-terminus. A set of crystal structures of human SIRT3 have been solved, including an apo-structure with no substrate, a structure with a peptide containing acetyl lysine of its natural substrate acetyl-CoA synthetase 2, a reaction intermediate structure trapped by a thioacetyl peptide, and a structure with the dethioacetylated peptide bond. These structures show the conformational changes induced by the two substrates required for the reaction, the acetylated substrate peptide and NAD+. In addition, a binding study by isothermal titration calorimetry suggests that the acetylated peptide is the first substrate to bind to SIRT3, prior to NAD+.\n\nFunction\n\nMitochondrial \n\nThree sirtuins, SIRT3, SIRT4 and SIRT5, are located in mitochondria and have been implicated in regulating metabolic processes. Endogenous SIRT3 is a soluble protein located in the mitochondrial matrix. Overexpression of SIRT3 in cultured cells increases respiration and decreases the production of reactive oxygen species. Fasting increases SIRT3 expression in white and brown adipose tissue (WAT and BAT, respectively) and overexpression of SIRT3 in HIB1B brown adipocytes increases the expression of PGC-1α and UCP1, suggesting a role for SIRT3 in adaptive thermogenesis BAT. BAT is different from WAT because it harbors large numbers of mitochondria and is important for thermogenesis in rodents. Thermogenesis in BAT is mediated by the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), which induces proton leakage and thereby generates heat instead of ATP. Mechanistic insights into how SIRT3 affects thermogenesis in BAT is lacking and whether SIRT3 affects UCP1 activity directly is not known.\n\nIn addition to controlling metabolism at the transcriptional level, sirtuins also directly control the activity of metabolic enzymes. In Salmonella enterica, the bacterial sirtuin CobB regulates the activity of the enzyme acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) synthetase. As mentioned above, orthologs of acetyl-CoA synthetase exist in the cytoplasm (AceCS1) and in mitochondria (AceCS2) in mammals. The presence of the sirtuin deacetylase SIRT3 in the mitochondrial matrix suggests the existence of lysine acetylated mitochondrial proteins. Indeed, SIRT3 deacetylates and activates the mammalian mitochondrial acetyl-coA synthetase (AceCS2). Furthermore, SIRT3 and AceCS2 are found complexed with one another, suggesting a critical role for control of AceCS2 activity by SIRT3.\n\nActivation of the NMNAT2 enzyme, which catalyze an essential step in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthetic pathway by SIRT3 may be a means of inhibiting axon degeneration and dysfunction.\n\nNuclear \n\nIn addition to its reported mitochondrial function, some researchers have proposed a very small pool of active nuclear SIRT3 exists. This pool is reported to consist of the long form of SIRT3 and has been suggested to have histone deacetylase activity. The observation that SIRT3 has nuclear activity came from a report that SIRT3 protected cardiomyocytes from stress mediated cell death and that this effect was due to deacetylation of a nuclear factor, Ku-70.\n\nClinical significance\n\nAging  \nThere is a strong association between SIRT3 alleles and longevity in males.\n\nActivation of SIRT3 inhibits the apoptosis leading to age-related macular degeneration. SIRT3 induced mitophagy, inhibiting cell death, and thus could be used to treat neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nCarcinogenesis \n\nThere is a significant body of published literature suggesting a strong mechanistic link between mitochondrial function, aging, and carcinogenesis. SIRT3 inhibits cancers that depend upon glycolysis, but promotes cancers that depend upon oxidative phosphorylation.\n\nSirt3 functions as a mitochondrial tumor suppressor protein. Although some evidence attributes SIRT3 activity in bypassing growth arrest in bladder carcinoma cells via regulation of p53 in the mitochondria. Damaged and aberrant mitochondrial function, similar to gene mutations, may be an early event that ultimately leads to the development of cancers. Mice genetically altered to delete Sirt3 develop estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER/PR) positive breast mammary tumors. In tumor samples from women with breast cancer, SIRT3 expression was decreased, as compared to normal breast tissues. Thus, the Sirt3 knockout model may be used to investigate ER/PR positive breast tumor development.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading",

        "A former Convent of Poor Clares is located in Woodchester, near Stroud in Gloucestershire. The convent was home to nuns of the Poor Clares order from 1850 to 2011.\n\nThe convent is based around a 17th-century house that was enlarged in the 1850s. The dedicated convent buildings were built between 1861 and 1869 by Charles Francis Hansom. A separate guest house was built around 1870 by Canon Scoles.\n\nThe convent is Grade II listed on the National Heritage List for England. The convent originally belonged to a Franciscan order before its adoption by the Poor Clares.\n\nFive sisters of the Poor Clares order remained at the convent's dissolution; they subsequently moved to a Poor Clares convent in Lynton, North Devon.\n\nPoor Clares exiled from France in 1904 joined Franciscan nuns at Woodchester. The convent at Woodchester was built in the 1860s; at its zenith, the convent housed 30 nuns after the Second World War, but it had declined to 12 mostly elderly nuns by 1998.\n\nDuff Hart-Davis visited the convent for a 1998 article in The Independent on Sunday and met the Mother Abbess, Sister Mary Anthony, and a Sister Mary Therese. Hart-Davis reported that the nuns' primary source of income was the production of altar breads, of which they made five million a year, earning them £25,000. The nuns also had a vegetable garden and an orchard and kept bees, cows, and chickens. Hart-Davis also wrote about the nuns' Christmas celebrations and reported that they did not have a television, but borrowed one for Christmas and Easter.\n\nThe Poor Clares donated their library from the Woodchester convent to Durham University Library. Durham's holdings comprise 485 titles from the Woodchester Convent, dating from the 16th to the 19th century, with the majority of books from the Poor Clares convent in Princehof near Bruges. The books are mostly devotional in nature.\n\nSince the convent's closure, the buildings have been used as a boutique hotel, restaurant and live music venue.\n\nReferences\n\n2011 disestablishments in England\nBuildings and structures in Stroud\nChristian monasteries established in the 16th century\nConvents in England\nGrade II listed monasteries\nGrade II listed buildings in Gloucestershire\nGrade II listed Roman Catholic churches in England\nMonasteries in Gloucestershire\nPoor Clare monasteries in England\nRoman Catholic churches in Gloucestershire",

        "NeXT Computer (also called the NeXT Computer System) is a workstation computer that was developed, marketed, and sold by NeXT Inc. It was introduced in October 1988 as the company's first and flagship product, at a price of , aimed at the higher-education market. It was designed around the Motorola 68030 CPU and 68882 floating-point coprocessor, with a clock speed of . Its NeXTSTEP operating system is based on the Mach microkernel and BSD-derived Unix, with a proprietary GUI using a Display PostScript-based back end. The enclosure consists of a 1-foot () die-cast magnesium cube-shaped black case, which led to the machine being informally referred to as \"The Cube\".\n\nThe NeXT Computer was renamed NeXTcube in a later upgrade. The NeXTstation, a more affordable version of the NeXTcube, was released in 1990.\n\nLaunch\n\nThe NeXT Computer was launched in October 1988 at a lavish invitation-only event, \"NeXT Introduction – the Introduction to the NeXT Generation of Computers for Education\" at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco, California. The next day, selected educators and software developers were invited to attend—for a $100 registration fee—the first public technical overview of the NeXT computer at an event called \"The NeXT Day\" at the San Francisco Hilton. It gave those interested in developing NeXT software an insight into the system's software architecture and object-oriented programming. Steve Jobs was the luncheon's speaker.\n\nReception\n\nIn 1989, BYTE magazine listed the NeXT Computer among the \"Excellence\" winners of the BYTE Awards, stating that it showed \"what can be done when a personal computer is designed as a system, and not a collection of hardware elements\". Citing as \"truly innovative\" the optical drive, DSP and object-oriented programming environment, it concluded that \"the NeXT Computer is worth every penny of its $6,500 market price\". It was, however, not a significant commercial success, failing to reach the level of high-volume sales like the Apple II, Commodore 64, Macintosh, or Microsoft Windows PCs.  The workstations were sold to universities, financial institutions, and government agencies.\n\nLegacy\n\nA NeXT Computer and its object-oriented development tools and libraries were used by Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau at CERN to develop the world's first web server (CERN httpd) and web browser (WorldWideWeb).\n\nThe NeXT platform was used by Jesse Tayler at Paget Press to develop the first electronic app store, called the Electronic AppWrapper, in the early 1990s. Issue #3 was first demonstrated to Steve Jobs at NeXTWorld Expo 1993.\n\nPioneering PC games Doom, Doom II, and Quake (with respective level editors) were developed by id Software on NeXT machines. Doom engine games such as Heretic, Hexen, and Strife were also developed on NeXT hardware using id's tools.\n\nNeXT technology provisioned the first online food delivery system called CyberSlice, using GIS based geolocation, on which Steve Jobs performed the first online order of pizza with tomato and basil. CyberSlice was curated into the Inventions of the 20th Century, Computer Science at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.\n\nSee also\n Previous, emulator of NeXT hardware\n NeXTstation\n NeXTcube\n NeXTcube Turbo\n NeXT character set\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n Byte Magazine, November 1988: The NeXT Computer Facsimile,  Full text\n Simson Garfinkel's NeXT pages including NeXTWorld Magazine\n The Best of NeXT Collection\n NeXT Computer brochure (page 7 contains a full size image of the circuit board)\n old-computers.com — NeXTcube\n Photos of black hardware\n\nComputer workstations\nHistory of the Internet\nNeXT\nSteve Jobs\n68k-based computers\n32-bit computers",
        "Thinsulate is a brand of synthetic fiber thermal insulation used in clothing. The word is a portmanteau of the words thin and insulate, trademarked by 3M. The material is made by the 3M Corporation and was first sold in 1979. It was originally marketed as an inexpensive alternative to down; at the time, 3M claimed it was twice as warm as an equivalent amount of any natural material.\n\nOriginally designed for clothing, it later became popular as an acoustic damping material. In 1997, 3M generated US$150 million in annual revenue from the product. Its development originated from other microfibre products made by 3M. It has been used in US army clothing since the mid 1980s.\n\nDescription \nThinsulate fibers are about  in diameter, which is thinner than the polyester fibers normally used in insulation for clothing such as gloves or winter jackets. Advertising material suggests that Thinsulate is more effective due to the increased density of fibers with decreased size of fibers compared with more traditional insulation. Like most insulation materials, the gaps between fibers not only reduce heat flow, but also allow moisture to escape. The insulation properties are beneficial for retaining some of the heat produced by the body for comfortable warmth while the moisture produced, most likely sweat, is supposed to evaporate. It retains its insulating properties when wet.\n\nThe thermal resistance R-value provided by Thinsulate products varies by the specific thickness and construction of the fabric.  Values (US units) range from 1.6 for 80-gram fabric to 2.9 for 200-gram fabric. Thinsulate is considered \"the warmest thin apparel insulation\" available. In fact, when equal thicknesses are compared, it provides about 1½ times the warmth of down and about twice the warmth of other high-loft insulation materials.\n\nMaterial safety data sheets from the manufacturer show that different varieties of Thinsulate are made from different mixtures of polymers, but most are primarily polyethylene terephthalate or a mixture of polyethylene terephthalate and polypropylene. Other materials in some include polyethylene terephthalate-polyethylene isophthalate copolymer and acrylic.\n\nThinsulate is now used in the fabric roof of the convertible automobile, the Porsche Boxster. The extra layer not only reduces heat loss but has also reduced noise levels inside the car by 3 decibels. It is also used in the roof of the Jaguar F-Type sports car. It features in the upholstery of Saturn sedans, Ford F-150 pickups, Buick Park Avenues, and F-16 fighters.\n\nIt is used in a wide variety of clothing products, such as footwear, gloves, hats, and coats. It became popular in outerwear jackets as early as 1985. The fibers are thinner in diameter than polyester fibres, so the material is used as a waterproof synthetic alternative to down.\n\nIn 2015 Thinsulate was named a recipient of an ISPO Award as a Top 10 Insulation.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\nSynthetic fibers\n3M brands\nProducts introduced in 1979\nInsulators",

Heinlein.\n\nBefore becoming a full-time author, she worked in several industries including as an AT&T shareowner correspondent, a construction assistant, then a bar steel assistant sales manager at an import firm.\n\nGreen began her full time writing career in 1984. Her early works were marketed as similar to John Norman's Gor series, but were actually intended as a rebuttal to Gor. Green said that she set out first to lampoon Norman's Gor books by creating three-dimensional female characters and powerful female characters in similar fantasy settings. Throughout her career she focused on writing strong female characters.\n\nPublished works\nThis is a selected list of Green's published works.\n\nHer website  reissued some of her older out-of-print books and released several new unissued eBooks series.\n\nThe Blending series \n\n Convergence: Book One of The Blending, Avon, November 1996\n Competitions: Book Two of The Blending, Avon, March 1997\n Challenges: Book Three of The Blending, Avon, May 1998\n Betrayals: Book Four of The Blending, Avon, February 1999\n Prophecy: Book Five of The Blending, Avon, July 1999\n\nThe Blending Enthroned series \nIntrigues: Book One of The Blending Enthroned, Eos, October 3, 2000\nDeceptions: Book Two of The Blending Enthroned, April 3, 2001\nDestiny: Book Three of The Blending Enthroned, Eos, April 2, 2002\n\nDiana Santee, Spaceways Agent series \nScience fiction series with later sequels released directly on Green's website.\n\n Mind Guest, DAW Books, 1984 (re-released online)\n Gateway to Xanadu, DAW Books, 1985 (re-released online with newly restored scenes)\n\nOnline Sequels \n\n Tanderon\n Tristesse Book One\n Tristesse Book Two\n Esmonia\n Xanthia\n Aysanne\n Tildor, CF Publications, 2008\n Restin, CF Publications, 2008\n Absar, CF Publications, 2008\n Gralling\n Durell\n\nFar Side of Forever series \nFantasy series\n\n The Far Side of Forever, DAW Books, 1987\n Hellhound Magic, DAW Books, 1989\n\nHidden Realms series \nFantasy series\n\n The Hidden Realms, Avon, 1993\n Game's End, Avon, April, 1996\n\nAlso part of Silver Princess, Golden Knight series:\n\n Dark Mirror, Dark Dreams, Avon, 1994\n\nJalav: Amazon Warrior series \nScience fiction series\nThe Crystals of Mida, DAW Books, 1982\nAn Oath to Mida, DAW Books, 1983\nChosen of Mida, DAW Books, 1984\nThe Will of the Gods, DAW Books, 1985\nTo Battle the Gods, DAW Books, 1986\n\nLady Blade, Lord Fighter series \nFantasy series released as a collection in 2001.\n\n Lady Blade, Lord Fighter (or The Silver Bracers), DAW Books, 1987 (online out-of-print reissue)\nThe Argent Swords, Bereshith Publishing, 2001 (online out-of-print reissue)\n\nLady Blade, Lord Fighter, Bereshith Publishing, 2001 (hardbound collector's edition)\n\nLawman series \nDirect-to-eBook releases through Green's website.\n\n Lawman\n Lawman2\n\nMind Warriors series \nTerrilian series sequels (direct-to-eBook releases through Green's website)\n\n Arrival\n Enemies\n Battles\n Tactics\n War\n Peace\n Serenity\n Onward\n\nSilver Princess, Golden Knight series \nFantasy series\n\n Silver Princess, Golden Knight, Avon, 1993 (out-of-print novel reissued online)\n Wind Whispers, Shadow Shouts, Avon, July 1995\n\nAlso part of Hidden Realms series:\n\n Dark Mirror, Dark Dreams, Avon, 1994\n\nTaz/Bell series \nDirect-to-eBook releases through Green's website.\n\n Dead Heat\n Dark Horse\n Down and Dirty\n Down and Dirty Part 2\n Double Trouble\n\nTerrilian series \nScience fiction series\n\n The Warrior Within, DAW Books, 1982 (out-of-print novel reissued online)\n The Warrior Enchained, DAW Books, 1983 (out-of-print novel reissued online)\n The Warrior Rearmed, DAW Books, 1984 (out-of-print novel reissued online)\n The Warrior Challenged, DAW Books, 1986 (out-of-print novel reissued online)\n The Warrior Victorious, DAW Books, 1987 (out-of-print novel reissued online)\n\nThe Thief and the Warrior series \nScience fiction series\n\n Mists of the Ages, DAW Books, 1988\n\nStandalone novels\n\nShort stories\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nAuthor website (2012 archive) \neBooks Order Site\n\n20th-century American novelists\n21st-century American novelists\nAmerican science fiction writers\nAmerican women short story writers\nAmerican women novelists\n1942 births\nLiving people\nWomen science fiction and fantasy writers\n20th-century American women writers\n21st-century American women writers\n20th-century American short story writers\n21st-century American short story writers",

        "The Punisher (re-titled Frank Castle: The Punisher after issue #66; sometimes referred to as The Punisher MAX) was a comic book ongoing series published under the MAX imprint of Marvel Comics, featuring vigilante and antihero the Punisher.\n\nPublication history\nGarth Ennis, also writer of the 2000 and 2001 Punisher series, wrote issues #1–60 of the series. Also like the earlier series, Tim Bradstreet provided the covers for those issues. Continuing his run on the character, Ennis used the freedom of the MAX imprint to write more graphic and hard-edged stories than had previously been seen. Ennis also wrote two miniseries accompanying the main series, The Punisher Presents: Barracuda and Born, and several one-shots.\n\nWith issue #61, Gregg Hurwitz replaced Ennis as writer, joining artist Laurence Campbell to do a five-issue story arc. With issue #66 released on January 21, 2009, the series was re-titled Frank Castle: The Punisher, with writer Duane Swierczynski and artist Michel Lacombe coming to the series. Victor Gischler came on board for the storyline \"Welcome to the Bayou\" in issues #71–74 before the title finished with issue #75, a double-length issue with stories by Thomas Piccirilli, Gregg Hurwitz, Duane Swierczynski, Peter Milligan, and Charlie Huston.\n\nThe title was relaunched as Punisher MAX in late 2009, with writer Jason Aaron and artist Steve Dillon.\n\nPlot\n\nDifferences from the mainstream Marvel Universe Punisher\nThe series explicitly does not use a floating timeline like the mainstream Marvel Universe, instead presenting a Punisher who ages in real time. Gravestones and other references indicate that his family was killed in 1976. The Punisher has been active for almost 30 years at the time presented in most stories, with issue #19 specifying that he has killed approximately 2,000 people. Born also establishes that the Punisher's service in the Vietnam War is still in MAX continuity.\n\nPromotional art for the cover of Punisher #44 (March 2007), gives Frank Castle's birth date as February 16, 1950, but that was removed for the published issues. The story \"Valley Forge, Valley Forge\" corroborates this date, referring to Castle as \"a twenty-one year old Captain\" in April 1971.\n\nAnother major difference is the complete lack of superheroes and supervillains in the series, although non-superpowered characters from the Punisher's past, most notably Microchip, do make appearances. Nick Fury also makes several notable appearances, with his characterization echoing Ennis' MAX-imprint Fury stories. However, the character Jen Cooke, a social worker, appeared in the Marvel Knights storyline \"Hidden\". She then appeared in the MAX storyline \"Slavers\". The character Yorkie Mitchell made appearances in both the Marvel Knights and the MAX Punisher comics.\n\nIn the Civil War Files comic, just before the \"Civil War\" storyline was published, Iron Man talked about events in the Punisher's past from the Marvel Knights and MAX comics, which indicated that it did happen in the mainstream Marvel Universe at some point:\n\n\"Captain Frank Castle, sole survivor of the Firebase Valley Forge massacre\".\n\"Although recently Castle has escalated his war on crime even further, with record-breaking body counts, he is paradoxically now rarely encountered in the field by any super hero save Daredevil\".\n\"It's almost like he inhabits two worlds, one where heroes can capture him and one where they can't, and he can slip from one to the other with ease\".\n\nMany characters are past or current intelligence and military operatives from governmental agencies like the American CIA, the Soviet KGB and the British SIS and SAS and militaries and militias from the Balkans, the Middle East and the IRA, all with agendas rooted in past conflicts like the Cold War or the Yugoslav Wars.\n\nPrints\n\nIssues\n\nAs of issue #66, the series was officially re-titled Frank Castle: The Punisher.\n\nCollected editions\n\nTrade paperbacks\n\nHardcovers\n\nComplete Collections\n\nOmnibus\n\nReception\nThe series holds an average rating of 7.9 by 38 professional critics on the review aggregation website Comic Book Roundup.\n\nIn other media\n\nFilm\n The 2008 movie Punisher: War Zone starring Ray Stevenson is inspired by Punisher MAX, most notably incorporating characters from that series such as Gaitano Cesare, Carmine \"Pittsy\" Gazzerra, Ink, Cristu Bulat, Tiberiu Bulat and Maginty. The scene where Frank Castle/the Punisher kills Gaitano Cesare and the other mobsters is also taken directly from the storyline \"In the Beginning\", albeit cutting the head off the former instead of a headshot.\n\nTelevision\n The second season of Daredevil loosely adapts the \"Kitchen Irish\" story arc, while adding in the titular character into the story alongside Frank Castle/the Punisher (portrayed by Jon Bernthal).\n The first season of The Punisher has William Rawlins as its main antagonist, a character who first appeared in issue #14.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n\n2004 comics debuts\n2009 comics endings\nComics by Garth Ennis\nComics set in New York City\nDefunct American comics",

        "\"Poland\" is a song by American rapper Lil Yachty. It was released on October 11, 2022, through Quality Control Music and Motown Records.\n\nBackground and release\nLil Yachty had been working on a \"non-rap album\" intended to be a \"psychedelic alternative project\", which he announced in January 2022. The song was originally recorded in 2021.\n\nIn October 2022, a snippet of \"Poland\" leaked to the Internet. Shortly after, the song was met with positive reception from listeners and other artists. Wiz Khalifa, DDG, and Denzel Curry were all cited as referencing the song in a positive manner. Drake, Steve Lacy, and Offset were also cited as posting videos of themselves listening to or singing along to the song. The song achieved virality, being popularly used on TikTok and spawning various Internet memes.\n\nThe song was officially released to all music streaming platforms on October 11, marking his first official solo track of 2022. @kurtoart, a Twitter user, drew art depicting Lil Yachty's fictional journey to Poland, accompanied by Wockhardt cough syrup (the \"wock\" referenced in the song's chorus). While the song's cover art was originally a map of Poland, shaded in a \"cough-syrup purple,\" Yachty announced he would change the cover art to @kurtoart's drawing.\n\nComposition and lyrics\nProduced by Lukrative, Lucian, and F1lthy of Working on Dying, the song features a synthy beat with a \"cyber-vibrato\" effect on Yachty's voice. A dissonant trap song, The Washington Posts Chris Richards wrote that \"Yachty makes his voice — a melodized yawn that has chafed low-imagination rap purists from the start — do something new, elongating the most flexible syllables and allowing them to tremble with Auto-Tuned vibrato.\"\n\n\"Poland\" has been noted by media outlets for its brevity and simple lyricism. In the song, Lil Yachty discusses \"fiending\" and battling his demons, and references the Nickelodeon comedy television series Kenan & Kel and its lead actors Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell. When going viral online, the lyric \"I took the wock to Poland\" was particularly singled out by listeners and garnered considerable media coverage. The term \"wock\" references Wockhardt, a pharmaceutical company known for producing types of cough syrup found in a cup of lean. Lil Yachty sings the lyric in \"a manner somewhere between an operatic recitative and singing through a fan\".\n\nPrior to the release of \"Poland\", Yachty previously mentioned \"wock\" on his song \"Wocky My Lover\". The rapper has never performed in the country of Poland, however the rapper revealed the mention of Poland in the song originally came about as trolling from the day when he had some wock and noticed someone else was drinking a Poland Spring water bottle.\n\nCritical reception\nThe song was praised by music journalists for its simplicity, with many outlets calling the song a \"catchy\", \"hypnotic\", or \"mystifying\" earworm. Its chorus featuring the \"I took the wock to Poland\" lyric was particularly lauded. Serge Selenou of Pitchfork opined that these factors are implemented in the rapper's best songs and wrote: \"Over a churning F1lthy beat that wouldn't be out of place on Whole Lotta Red, Yachty croons \"I took the Wock to Poland\" in a garbled yodel that probably has Mason Ramsey jealous\"; Selenou added that the song helped recapture the \"light-heartedness that won Yachty fans.\"\n\nEric Skelton of Complex wrote that the hook on Poland is \"so unique that we can't stop thinking about it,\" adding that Yachty's performance on the song is akin to \"singing through a fan as he belts out \"I took the wock to Poland\" with extra warble in his voice.\" Skelton called the song \"bizarre\", and added that \"Poland\" is \"weird as hell, strangely addictive, and ridiculously fun to sing along with.\"\n\nRichards praised the Auto-Tune vibrato effect applied to Yachty's voice, writing that \"in this funny, freaky, emotionally extravagant, tragicomic gush, he sounds like a machine that’s learned how to cry.\" Richards also positively received the song's concise nature, opining that \"Yachty's brevity is casually artful, highly playful and totally real. \"Poland\" isn't short, it's fleeting, and you might even find the meaning of life in the difference between the two.\"\n\nRecognition\nOn October 12, 2022, Quality Control Music CEO Pierre Thomas shared an alleged text conversation with Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. The conversation shows Morawiecki inviting Lil Yachty to Poland.\n\nMusic video\nAn accompanying music video was produced by Lyrical Lemonade and released onto YouTube on October 11, 2022. Directed by Cole Bennett, the music video has received over 10.2 million views as of October 20. The video was filmed on the streets of Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood and in the Broadway–Lafayette Street/Bleecker Street station of the New York City Subway.\n\nCharts\n\nCertifications\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \n\n2022 songs\nCloud rap songs\nInternet memes introduced in 2022\nLil Yachty songs\nPsychedelic songs\nSongs about drugs\nSongs about Poland\nSongs written by Lil Yachty",

        "Cowboy Classics: Playing Favorites II is the twenty-fourth album by American singer-songwriter Michael Martin Murphey. It is Murphey's follow-up to his 2001 compilation Playing Favorites and contains rerecorded versions of many of his cowboy songs. Murphey's attraction to the cowboy's way of life is an attempt to preserve his own cultural heritage, breathing new life into classics like \"I Ride an Old Paint\", \"Red River Valley\", and \"Yellow Rose of Texas\". Among the highlights of the album is a stately six-minute version of \"Streets of Laredo\", arranged for fiddle and piano. In the liner notes, Murphey includes a short note concerning each of the song's origins.\n\nTrack listing\n \"I Ride An Old Paint\" (Traditional) – 3:36\n \"Whoopie Ti-Ti-Yo\" – 2:26\n \"The Old Chisholm Trail\" – 4:39\n \"Strawberry Roan\" – 4:15\n \"Red River Valley\" – 5:41\n \"Little Joe the Wrangler\" (Thorp) – 4:10\n \"The Colorado Trail\" – 3:42\n \"Tying Knots In the Devils Tail\" – 3:09\n \"When the Work's All Done This Fall\" – 4:15\n \"The Yellow Rose of Texas\" (Traditional) – 2:50\n \"Utah Carroll\" – 3:45\n \"The Bard of Armagh\" / \"Streets of Laredo\" (Traditional) – 6:58\n \"I Ride An Old Paint\" (reprise) (Traditional) – 1:48\n\nCredits\nMusic\n Michael Martin Murphey – vocals, acoustic guitar\n Ryan Murphey – acoustic guitar, nylon strings, producer\n Pat Flynn – acoustic guitar, nylon strings\n Chris Leuzinger – acoustic & electric guitars, nylon strings\n Jonathan Yudkin – mandolin, fiddle\n David Hoffner – piano\n Joey Miskulin – accordion\n Paul Sadler – hammered dulcimer\n Craig Nelson – upright bass\n Matt Pierson – upright bass\n Bobby Blazier – drums\n Daniel Marvel – drums\n\nProduction\n Keith Compton – engineer\n Michael Page – art direction\n John Sheppard – photography\n William Matthews – cover painting, watercolor art\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Michael Martin Murphey's Official Website\n\n2002 albums\nMichael Martin Murphey albums\nWestern music (North America) albums\nSequel albums",

        "The National Points Championship is a season-long competition for BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars. The winner is granted the honour of racing with a silver roof for the following season.\n\nHistory\nThe first season-long championship started in 1956. Drivers' scores at every stock car meeting were recorded to create the championship table. During the late 1990s, when Frankie Wainman Junior dominated, there was criticism that the National Points Championship was predictable and favoured drivers who had the money to race at as many meetings as possible. The National Series was created in 2002. Rather than the points accumulated over the entire season counting towards the winner, the National Series was competed for over 35 designated meetings. The season-long National Points Championship survived, but its importance was downgraded, and the privilege of racing with a silver roof for the following season was transferred from it to the National Series.\n\nIn 2009, the National Series was amended. This time, the top ten points-scoring drivers over the first two-thirds of the season were entered in the National Series Shootout, beginning with no points except for a small number of meeting attendance points. The drivers raced over ten designated Shootout rounds, with the points scored in them deciding the winner of the National Series. In 2010, the number of competing drivers was increased to twelve. From 2012, the National Series Shootout was rebranded the National Points Championship Shootout.\n\nThe most successful driver in National Points Championships and National Series is Frankie Wainman Junior, who has won fourteen. Other notable multiple winners include Stuart Smith (thirteen), John Lund (six), Fred Mitchell (three), Andy Smith (three) and Frankie Wainman (three).\n\nList of winners\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n National Points Championship information at F1stockcars.com\n National Series/Points statistics at BriSCAF1stox.com\n\nStock car racing in the United Kingdom\nStock car racing series\nAuto racing series in the United Kingdom\nMotorsport competitions in the United Kingdom",

The novel was published by Chatto & Windus in 2002. \n\nThe novel is the final in a sequence of four books, preceded by The Virgin in the Garden (1978), Still Life (1985), and Babel Tower (1996). Jonathan Walker, in a paper published by Contemporary Literature, referred to the series of books as the \"Frederica quartet\". Byatt herself expressed a preference for The Virgin in the Garden quartet when speaking about it (\"It isn't Frederica's book--though she's the sort of person who would muscle in and try to take it!\") and noted her publisher's intention to produce a boxed set, simply titled The Quartet.\n\nByatt has said the novel is \"about utopianism...and a dangerous sort of mystical romanticism\".\n\nA Whistling Woman is half dedicated to Frances Ashcroft.\n\nReferences\n\n2002 British novels\nChatto & Windus books\nNovels by A.

        "The Bavarian Class D XI engines were branch line (Lokalbahn) saturated steam locomotives built for service with the Royal Bavarian State Railways (Königlich Bayerische Staatsbahn).\n\nHistory \nThe state railway procured 139 examples between 1895 and 1912; it was the most numerous Bavarian branch line locomotive. Both Krauss and Maffei supplied three prototypes each and both were later involved in the production batches. \n\nEight locomotives of the same type were supplied by Krauss in 1900 to the Lokalbahn AG (Lokalbahn Aktien-Gesellschaft or LAG), which later sold them to the Bavarian state railway, where they were given the numbers 2507 to 2512. A further three locomotives were supplied by Krauss to the South German Electric Branch Lines (AG Süddeutsche elektrische Lokalbahnen) that was taken over in 1904 by the LAG; again these locomotives were sold to the state railway. They were given the numbers 2762–2764. These machines were designated as Class PtL 3/4 under the new classification scheme, but did not differ significantly from the newer Class D XI engines. Another five PtL 3/4 were procured by the state railway in 1914 and given the numbers 2783–2787.\n\nThree of these locomotives were also produced for the Palatinate Railway (Pfalzbahn) as the T 4.II, but these had different dimensions, including smaller driving and carrying wheels.\n\nThe Deutsche Reichsbahn took over all 147 vehicles in 1925 as the  DRG Class 98.4-5. The D XI engines were given the numbers 98 411–556 and the PtL 3/4 machines the numbers 98 561–568. About half the locomotives were retired between 1931 and 1933.\n\nTwo machines remained after the Second World War in Czechoslovakia and four in Austria. The latter were numbers 98 500, 514, 546 und 549, which were given the numbers 791.01–04 by the Austrian Federal Railway (Österreichische Bundesbahn or ÖBB). They were taken out of service in 1957.\n\nThe Deutsche Bundesbahn took over 56 engines in 1945. The last loco was taken out of service in 1960 in Nuremberg and transferred to Ingolstadt. There it was set up as a memorial in front of the station in 1968. This sole surviving example of the Bavarian D XI is cared for today by the Apian-Gymnasium at Ingolstadt.\n\nA 1:10 scale model of this locomotive was built between 1962 and 1964 in the training workshops of the Weiden depot (AW Weiden) and is today in the railway museum of Weiden in der Oberpfalz.\n\nDesign \nThese locomotives were among the first to be fitted with a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie. Some received a counter-pressure brake of the Riggenbach type.\n\nThe five PtL 3/4 locomotives differ from the previous ones in having a longer length over buffers of 9,306 mm, a slightly lower indicated power of 310 PSi and a slightly greater coal capacity of 1.8 tons.\n\nLMKO 1 to 11, LAG 62 to 64 \nFor the construction of the Murnau–Kohlgrub–Oberammergau Local Railway (LMKO), the South German Electric Local Railway Company (Aktien-Gesellschaft Süddeutsche elektrische Lokalbahnen) procured two locomotives from Krauss with serial numbers 3930 and 3931, which were delivered in August 1899. When it was realised that the electrification of the route would not be completed in time for the 1900 Oberammergau Passion Play, further locomotives of the D XI class were procured in two batches (factory numbers 4129 to 4131 and 4260 to 4265). The eleven locomotives were given operating numbers LMKO 1 to 11.\n\nOn the bankruptcy of the South German Electric Local Railway Company in October 1901, the Royal Bavarian State Railways took over services between Murnau and Oberammergau. As a result, locomotives LMKO 4 to 11 were taken over by the state railways and given operating numbers 2505 to 2512.\n\nThe remaining three locomotives went to Lokalbahn Aktien-Gesellschaft (LAG) in 1904 when they bought the Murnau–Oberammergau line. The LAG gave them operating numbers 62 to 64 and, in addition to their primary line, they were also used on the Murnau–Garmisch-Partenkirchen Localbahn line. On the nationalization of the Murnau–Garmisch-Partenkirchen railway in 1908, these three locomotives also became the property of the Royal Bavarian State Railways and were classified as PtL 3/4 with operating numbers 2762 to 2764.\n\nOverview\n\nTrivium \nAfter the three locomotives LAG 62 to 64 were transferred to the Royal Bavarian State Railways, their old LAG operating numbers were incorporated into their new ones. For example, no. 62 became no. 2762.\n\nSee also \n Royal Bavarian State Railways\n List of Bavarian locomotives and railbuses\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nRailway locomotives introduced in 1895\n0-6-2T locomotives\nD 11\nStandard gauge locomotives of Germany\nKrauss locomotives\nMaffei locomotives\nC1′ n2t locomotives",

        "Darren Varley (1973–1999) was a man from Alberta, Canada who died after a scuffle with police in a jail cell in Alberta after he was arrested for drunkenness.\n\nBackground\nBorn in Pincher Creek, Alberta, Varley was a truck driver who lived in Pincher Creek his entire life.\n\nArrest\nOn October 2, 1999, he had just finished a long day at work and headed to a local pub where he was to meet his sister. After several hours of drinking, Varley had become intoxicated. At the same time, RCMP Constable Michael Ferguson had just finished taking two prospective officers for an extensive ride in his police car, showing them the ins-and-outs of the area. He dropped them off just an hour before the pubs closed at 3:00a.m., according to the Crown.\n\nFerguson received a call from the RCMP dispatcher based in Red Deer about an intoxicated complainant, Darren Varley, reporting a missing person. Varley phoned from the local hospital where he was checking on his friend, Tuckey, who had been just beaten up in a fight in which both men had been involved in with two other men. The fight had occurred in the pub parking lot as a result of Varley knocking down one of the men's wives.\n\nThe drunken Varley had given the RCMP dispatcher the first statement on what he incorrectly believed to be a missing woman, Chandelle. Constable Ferguson decided to arrest Darren Varley for public drunkenness and bring him to the local police detachment.\n\nAfter placing Varley in the police car, Constable Ferguson returned to the hospital to investigate the missing persons report. Within minutes Varley had kicked out the police car window and attempted to slide out of the vehicle.\n\nDeath\nWhile at the police department, and booking Varley into the last jail cell, Constable Ferguson stated that Varley had pulled his bulletproof vest over his head and gained momentary control of his pistol through what experts testified was a little-known defect in the holster design. An altercation occurred at which time Ferguson regained enough control of the gun to fire two quick shots. One grazed the side of Varley's abdomen and the other shot pierced his skull just behind the ear.  Varley, now breathing with severe difficulty, lay wounded on the cell floor while Constable Ferguson called the ambulance, which attended moments later. Varley was airlifted to a Calgary hospital where he was pronounced dead.\n\nCourt verdict \nAfter two attempts by the Crown which both ended in mistrials from hung juries to try Michael Ferguson for the killing of Darren Varley, a third attempt was made to try him for manslaughter. Five years after the killing of Darren Varley, Constable Michael Ferguson was found guilty and convicted of manslaughter.\n\nThe mandatory sentence for manslaughter in Canada, is a four-year closed prison term in incidents involving a firearm. Justice Ged Hawco, ruled to make a constitutional exemption to the firearm clause because the police revolver was present as a result of Constable Ferguson's duties and allow Michael Ferguson to serve an exceptional two-year less a day term in his own home. Justice Hawco came to the conclusion that Michael Ferguson fired the first shot in self-defense, but the second shot was unnecessary.\n\nJustice Hawco stated in his Reasons for Judgment, \"If I were to place Mr. Ferguson on this ladder of moral culpability, given the facts which the jury must have concluded, he would be on the very lower rungs.\"\n\nSentence overruled \nOn September 26, 2006, the Alberta Court of Appeal overruled Justice Ged Hawko's decision to allow Ferguson the opportunity to serve his sentence at his house. The court ruled that Ferguson must serve a four-year prison term.\n \nFamily and supporters of Darren Varley expressed disappointment that he may be granted nearly immediate parole, having considered to have served nearly two years under house arrest which would be credited to his prison sentence.\n\nOn  September 25, 2006, Ferguson began a four-year prison sentence.\n\nBy early 2007 Ferguson was out on parole and the Supreme Court had agreed to hear Ferguson's appeal. In 2008, the appeal struck down his sentence. According to his lawyer, Noel O'Brien, the decision was based on the conclusion that \"where a mandatory minimum sentence amounts to 'cruel and unusual punishment' and thus a violation under s. 12 of the Charter Of Rights, the only option open to a trial judge is to strike down the legislation itself, even if the mandatory punishment would be constitutional in the vast majority of cases. The ruling means that if a law creating a mandatory minimum sentence is unconstitutional for \"any\" individual, it will be unconstitutional for \"all\" individuals.\"\n\nReferences\n\nSee also\n List of controversies involving the Royal Canadian Mounted Police\n Ian Bush\n\n1973 births\n1999 deaths\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police\nManslaughter victims\nCanadian victims of crime\nCanadian truck drivers\nPeople from the Municipal District of Pincher Creek No. 9\nPeople shot dead by law enforcement officers in Canada\nDeaths by firearm in Alberta",

        "Estrone glucuronide, or estrone-3-D-glucuronide, is a conjugated metabolite of estrone. It is formed from estrone in the liver by UDP-glucuronyltransferase via attachment of glucuronic acid and is eventually excreted in the urine by the kidneys. It has much higher water solubility than does estrone. Glucuronides are the most abundant estrogen conjugates and estrone glucuronide is the dominant metabolite of estradiol.\n\nWhen exogenous estradiol is administered orally, it is subject to extensive first-pass metabolism (95%) in the intestines and liver. A single administered dose of estradiol is absorbed 15% as estrone, 25% as estrone sulfate, 25% as estradiol glucuronide, and 25% as estrone glucuronide. Formation of estrogen glucuronide conjugates is particularly important with oral estradiol as the percentage of estrogen glucuronide conjugates in circulation is much higher with oral ingestion than with parenteral estradiol. Estrone glucuronide can be reconverted back into estradiol, and a large circulating pool of estrogen glucuronide and sulfate conjugates serves as a long-lasting reservoir of estradiol that effectively extends its terminal half-life of oral estradiol. In demonstration of the importance of first-pass metabolism and the estrogen conjugate reservoir in the pharmacokinetics of estradiol, the terminal half-life of oral estradiol is 13 to 20 hours whereas with intravenous injection its terminal half-life is only about 1 to 2 hours.\n\nSee also\n Catechol estrogen\n Estradiol sulfate\n Estriol glucuronide\n Estriol sulfate\n Estrogen conjugate\n Lipoidal estrogen\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Metabocard of Estrone Glucuronide – Human Metabolome Database\n\nEstranes\nEstrogens\nEstrone esters\nGlucuronide esters\nHuman metabolites",

        "Feodor Ivanovich Vilesov (; 13 November 1925 – 8 February 1978) was a Soviet experimental physicist whose main contributions are in the field of chemical  physics.\n\nEducation and early life \nVilesov was born in Belyukovo village near Kudymkar, in Komi-Permyak Okrug (autonomous national district), Perm region, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union, on November 13, 1925, to a couple of: Ivan Ilvich Vilesov and Vassa Vasilievna Vilesova. During 1943 -1950 he served in the Soviet Army. In 1950 he entered the Department of Physics, Leningrad State University, from which he graduated with an honorable diploma (master's degree) in 1955. He continued with his Ph. D. studies at the Institute of Physics, Leningrad State University, in the department of photonics led by Professor A. N. Terenin and in 1959 he defended his thesis “The Study of Photoionization of vapors of organic molecules and interrogation of the influence of adsorbed layers on photoelectric Emission from Semiconductor Catalysts”. He obtained his Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (a \"higher doctorate\") degree in 1966 for a thesis on the development of photoelectron spectroscopy in the gas phase and molecular solids entitled: “Photoionization of Organic Molecules”\n\nCareer \nFrom 1955 to 1978, he worked at the Institute for Physics of the Leningrad State University. Since 1964, he was the head of the department of photonics (photochemistry). In 1967 he becomes a professor in physics at Leningrad State University. In 1977-1978 he served as the dean of sciences of the Leningrad State University.\n\nIn a series of works in 1960–1962, Vilesov and his colleagues performed the first experiments on Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) of molecular solids and gases. Since then Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy has been widely applied to study valence energy levels and chemical bonding, especially the bonding character of molecular orbitals.\n\nHonors and awards \nVilesov was awarded the USSR State Prize in 1985, —for the development of the method of photoelectron spectroscopy and its application in science and technology, published in 1961–1985.\n\nPersonal life \nVilesov was the son of Ivan Ivanovich Vilesov (1906-1967) and Vassa Vasilievna (1905-1984). He was married to Vera Konstantinovna Adamchuk (1933-2016) and had 1 child, Andrey Feodorovich Vilesov.\n\nHe died on 8 February 1978 at the age of 52.\n\nReferences \n\n1925 births\n1978 deaths\nSoviet physicists\nExperimental physicists\nSoviet inventors",

        "The Pembrokeshire Militia, later the Royal Pembroke Rifles, was an auxiliary regiment reorganised from earlier precursor units in the Welsh county of Pembrokeshire during the 18th Century. Primarily intended for home defence, it served in Britain and Ireland through all Britain's major wars. It was converted into garrison artillery in 1853 and continued until it was disbanded in 1909.\n\nPembroke Trained Bands\n\nThe universal obligation to military service in the Shire levy was long established in England and   was extended to Wales. King Henry VIII called a 'Great Muster' in 1539, which showed the following available in the newly reorganised county of Pembrokeshire:\n County of Pembrokeshire: 1166 men available for service, of whom 139 had 'harness' (armour)\n Lordship of Haverfordwest: 454 (43 with harness)\n Tenants of Thomas Jones in both those places and in the Hundred of Dewisland: 380 with 4 'nags' (horses)\n Cilgerran Hundred: 254 \n\nThe legal basis of the militia was updated by two Acts of 1557 covering musters and the maintenance of horses and armour. The county militia was now under the Lord Lieutenant, assisted by the Deputy Lieutenants and Justices of the Peace (JPs). The entry into force of these Acts in 1558 is seen as the starting date for the organised Militia of England and Wales. Although the militia obligation was universal, it was clearly impractical to train and equip every able-bodied man, so after 1572 the practice was to select a proportion of men for the Trained Bands, who were mustered for regular training. During the Armada crisis of 1588 Pembrokeshire furnished 800 trained foot and 30 'petronel's (the petronel was an early cavalry firearm).\n\nIn the 16th Century little distinction was made between the militia and the troops levied by the counties for overseas expeditions. However, the counties usually conscripted the unemployed and criminals rather than send the trained bandsmen. Between 1585 and 1602 Pembrokeshire supplied 610 men for service in Ireland and 30 for the Netherlands. The levies were commanded by professional captains rather than local men: in 1601 a captain who had raised 100 troops in Gloucestershire was ordered to take the 50 from Pembrokeshire under his  command as well. The men were given 'conduct money' to get to the embarkation ports. This was recovered from the government, but replacing the weapons issued to the levies from the militia armouries was a heavy cost on the counties.\n\nWith the passing of the threat of invasion, the trained bands declined in the early 17th Century. Later, King Charles I attempted to reform them into a national force or 'Perfect Militia' answering to the king rather than local control. The Pembrokeshire Trained Bands of 1638 consisted of 557 men, 276 armed with muskets and 281 'Corslets' (body armour, signifying pikemen). They also mustered 57 horse. Part of this force may have been organised as the North Pembroke Trained Band. Pembrokeshire was ordered to send 300 men overland to Newcastle upon Tyne for the Second Bishops' War of 1640. However, substitution was rife and many of those sent on this unpopular service would have been untrained replacements.\n\nCivil Wars\nControl of the militia was one of the areas of dispute between Charles I and Parliament that led to the English Civil War. When open war broke out between the King and Parliament, neither side made much use of the trained bands beyond securing the county armouries for their own full-time troops. Most of Wales was under Royalist control for much of the war, and was a recruiting ground for the King's armies. However, Pembrokeshire was divided, with the coastal towns of Pembroke and Tenby leaning towards Parliament. These were vital for the Royal army to land supplies and reinforcements from Ireland. On 18 September 1643 during his campaign to take these two towns, the Earl of Carbery as the King's Lieutenant-General for Carmarthenshire, Cardiganshire and Pembrokeshire, summoned the Pembrokeshire TBs to Haverfordwest, where they declared for the King and were presumably absorbed into his army. However, Pembroke and Tenby were later recovered by Rowland Laugharne for Parliament.\n\nOnce Parliament had established full control in 1648 it passed new Militia Acts that replaced lords lieutenant with county commissioners appointed by Parliament or the Council of State. At the same time the term 'Trained Band' began to disappear in most counties. Under the Commonwealth and Protectorate the militia received pay when called out, and operated alongside the New Model Army to control the country. By 1651 the militias of the South Welsh counties appear to have been combined, with the 'South Wales Militia' being ordered to rendezvous at Gloucester to hold the city during the Worcester campaign.\n\nPembrokeshire Militia\nAfter the Restoration of the Monarchy, the Militia was re-established by the The King's Sole Right over the Militia Act 1661 under the control of the king's lords lieutenant, the men to be selected by ballot. This was popularly seen as the 'Constitutional Force' to counterbalance a 'Standing Army' tainted by association with the New Model Army that had supported Cromwell's military dictatorship.\n\nThe militia forces in the Welsh counties were small, and were grouped together under the direction of the Lord President of the Council of Wales. As Lord President, the Duke of Beaufort carried out a tour of inspection of the Welsh militia in 1684. On 11 August, when he inspected the Pembrokeshire Militia near Haverfordwest, it consisted of a regiment of foot ('all of firelocks', ie musketeers with no pikemen) and one Troop of horse. The 1697 militia returns showed the foot as 456 strong under Colonel Sir Thomas Stepney, 5th Baronet, High Sheriff of Pembrokeshire, organised in seven companies (one commanded by the Mayor of Pembroke), and the troop of 36 horse under Captain Arthur Owen, MP for Pembrokeshire.\n\nGenerally the militia declined in the long peace after the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713. Jacobites were numerous amongst the Welsh Militia, but they did not show their hands during the Risings of 1715 and 1745, and bloodshed was avoided.\n\n1757 reforms\n\nSeven Years' War\nUnder threat of French invasion during the Seven Years' War a series of Militia Acts from 1757 re-established county militia regiments, the men being conscripted by means of parish ballots (paid substitutes were permitted) to serve for three years. There was a property qualification for officers, who were commissioned by the lord lieutenant. An adjutant and drill sergeants were to be provided to each regiment from the Regular Army, and arms and accoutrements would be supplied when the county had secured 60 per cent of its quota of recruits.\n\nPembrokeshire was given a quota of 160 men to raise. Some of the Welsh counties were slow to complete their regiments: the problem was less with the other ranks raised by ballot than the shortage of men qualified to be officers, even after the requirements were lowered for Welsh counties. On 29 July 1758 Sir William Owen, 4th Baronet, of Orielton, the Lord Lieutenant of Pembrokeshire, advertised for suitably qualified men to come forward, and must have obtained a sufficient number: he appointed his eldest son, Hugh Owen (later 5th Baronet) as colonel. The militia ballot was then enforced and the Pembrokeshire regiment received its arms on 7 September 1759. It was embodied for permanent service at Haverfordwest, Pembroke Town and Narberth on 15 December that year.\n\nAfter a short period of training and organised into four small companies the regiment marched off in January 1760 to take up garrison duties at Bristol. In February it was posted to Monmouthshire, where it alternated between Monmouth and Chepstow until the end of May. It was then posted to Carmarthen, arriving on 6 June, and remained there before returning to Pembrokeshire in October. The following spring it served in Cardiganshire, with companies in various towns including Cardigan and Aberystwyth. It went back to Pembrokeshire in August 1761, with various detachments until it concentrated at Haverfordwest in November 1762. The war was coming to an end, and the warrant to disembody the regiment was executed on 4 December 1762. The disembodied regiment was kept up to strength by means of the ballot over subsequent years, but it was rarely assembled for training.\n\nAmerican War of Independence\n\nThe American War of Independence broke out in 1775, and by 1778 Britain was  threatened with invasion by the Americans' allies, France and Spain. The militia were embodied, and the Pembrokeshires were called out on 26 March, assembling at Haverfordwest shortly afterwards under the command of Major Wyriot Owen. His second-in-command was Capt John Colby, brother-in-law of the former colonel, now Sir Hugh Owen, 5th Baronet of Orielton and Lord Lieutenant of Pembrokeshire.\n\nOn 1 May 1778 the regiment was ordered to Bristol, and from there it was marched to Coxheath Camp near Maidstone in Kent. This was the army's largest training camp, where the Militia were exercised as part of a division alongside Regular troops while providing a reserve in case of French invasion of South East England. The understrength militia units from small counties (Montgomery, Radnor and Pembroke) were attached to guard the artillery park of the division. On 4 November the camp broke up and the Pembrokeshires marched into Maidstone for winter quarters, sending parties back to Haverfordwest to collect recruits. The regiment spent the summer of 1779 in Essex, where it joined other militia regiments at Warley Camp. By November detachments were billeted in villages north and east of London, but the regiment then marched off to winter quarters in Haverfordwest, arriving on 18 December.\n\nColby took command of the regiment in January 1780 with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. In addition to its balloted companies, the regiment now had two companies enlisted from volunteers, one of which was designated the Light Company. The regiment moved to Pembroke in January, and then in May marched to Tiptree Camp in Essex. The Gordon Riots broke out in London in June, and the Pembroke Militia was called out in aid of the civil power, with short deployments to Brentwood and Romford, without any clashes occurring. In the winter the regiment was quartered across Essex with detachments including Harwich and Wivenhoe. In February 1781 the Harwich detachment relieved the Radnorshire Militia at Landguard Fort and the Wivenhoe detachment moved into Ipswich. The following winter the regiment was again distributed across Essex towns and villages.\n\nIn spring 1782 the Pembrokeshires returned to Coxheath Camp, where it became part of a brigade including the Brecknockshire and Merionethshire Militia regiments and Sir John Leicester's Dragoons, all commanded by Lt-Col Colby. The Pembrokeshires remained in Kent for the winter, with two companies at Dover, one at Folkestone and the remainder at Hythe and Sandgate. Much of the duty involved guarding prisoners-of-war. A peace treaty had been agreed and the war was now coming to an end, so warrants to disembody the militia were issued on 28 February 1783. The Pembrokeshires marched back to Haverfordwest where they were disembodied in mid- March.\n\nFrom 1784 to 1792 the militia ballot was used to keep up militia numbers and the regiments were assembled for their 28 days' annual peacetime training, but to save money only two-thirds of the men were actually mustered each year. The Lord Lieutenant of Pembrokeshire, Richard Philipps, 1st Lord Milford, became Colonel of the Regiment on 10 June 1786, but John Colby remained lieutenant-colonel.\n\nFrench Revolutionary War\nThe militia was already being called out when Revolutionary France declared war on Britain on 1 February 1793. The Pembrokeshire Militia under Lt-Col Colby had already been embodied at Haverfordwest on 2 January and later that month it marched via Worcester to Romford in Essex, where it was stationed until June.\n\nThe French Revolutionary Wars saw a new phase for the English militia: they were embodied for a whole generation, and became regiments of full-time professional soldiers (though restricted to service in the British Isles), which the regular army increasingly saw as a prime source of recruits. They served in coast defences, manning garrisons, guarding prisoners-of-war, and for internal security, while their traditional local defence duties were taken over by the Volunteers and mounted Yeomanry.\n\nFrom July to October 1793 the Pembrokeshire Militia was at Warley Camp, then returned to Romford and Hare Street for the winter, during which it received a draft of newly-balloted men from Pembrokeshire. Between February and June 1794 it was quartered across various Essex villages before concentrating at Warley. In November it transferred to Yarmouth in Norfolk, where all ranks were billeted in public houses and inns until May 1795. That month it moved into a tented camp outside the town. In October and November it went to various village before settling at Holt for the winter. In April 1796 the regiment joined the garrison at Landguard Fort where it provided 'additional gunners'.\n\nIn a fresh attempt to have as many men as possible under arms for home defence in order to release regulars, in 1796 the Government created the Supplementary Militia, a compulsory levy of men to be trained in their spare time, and to be incorporated in the Regular Militia in emergency. Pembrokeshire's new militia quota was fixed at 331 men. Lieutenant-Col Colby went back to Pembrokeshire to supervise the training of the county's supplementaries and was on the scene on 22 February 1797 when a French force landed at Fishguard on the north Pembrokeshire coast. A force of militia, yeomanry  and volunteers was quickly gathered at Haverfordwest under the command of Lord Cawdor to oppose this invasion. Colby sent his Pembroke supplementaries to relieve  a detachment of the Cardiganshire Militia guarding the prisoners at Pembroke Dock, allowing the better-trained Cardigan men to join Cawdor. Colby himself was probably with Cawdor as an adviser during the minor skirmishing that followed (the Battle of Fishguard) and the subsequent negotiations for the French surrender.\n\nBy July the Pembroke supplementaries had completed their training, and those who did not accept a bounty to join the Regular Army were marched off to join the regiment at Landguard Fort. On 13 September the regiment marched to take over garrison duties at Bristol.\n\nIreland 1799\nIn 1798 a rebellion broke out in Ireland and an Act of Parliament was passed to allow English and Welsh militia regiments to serve there. The Pembrokeshires volunteered for six months' service and embarked at Bristol on 6 April 1799. The regiment arrived at Cork on 18 April, by which time the rebellion had been crushed. After six months' uneventful service, Colby (who had been promoted to Colonel on 23 April) endeavoured to induce the men to extend their service, but they were unwilling, and the regiment embarked at Waterford on 10 November.\n\nThe officers were aggrieved that Col Colby had bypassed them and taken the proposal to extend the Irish service direct to the other ranks. Some of his subordinates attempted to have him court-martialled. Colby resigned and Lt-Col William Scourfield became commandant.\n\nIn May 1800 The regiment went into camp on Maker Heights as part of the Plymouth garrison, under the second-in-command, Maj John Lloyd. In common with other small Welsh militia units, the Pembrokeshires provided men to assist the gunners in the redoubts protecting the naval dockyard. Having supplied numbers of volunteers to the Line Regiments, the Pembrokeshires were now down to 170 men out of an establishment of 370, reduced to 201 in 1802 as the war came to a conclusion. After winter quarters in Carmarthen the regiment was back in Haverfordwest when the Treaty of Amiens was signed on 25 March 1802. The Pembrokeshire Militia was disembodied there early in April.\n\nNapoleonic Wars\nHowever, the Peace of Amiens was shortlived and the regiment was embodied again on 25 March 1803. It was now under Lt-Col Owen Philipps who had become commandant on 2 July 1802. However, he joined the regiment late, and it was marched from Haverfordwest to Chelmsford, Essex, under Maj John Mathias in mid-May. It then established regimental headquarters (HQ) at Colchester with detachments across Essex, and was brought up to strength by a draft of supplementary militiamen.\n\nFor several years, the regiment had informally used the title of  Royal Pembrokeshire Militia: on 23 April 1804 this was made official when, along with 11 other Welsh militia regiments, it was granted the 'Royal' prefix.\n\nThe HQ remained at Colchester until the summer of 1806, when the detachments were called in and the regiment concentrated at Maldon before joining the Harwich garrison. In June 1808 the regiment transferred to the Bristol garrison. The following month the Royal Pembrokeshires (except one man) volunteered to be attached to the 43rd (Monmouthshire) Light Infantry for service with Sir John Moore in the Peninsular War in Spain. Although the offer was not taken up, the regiment was thanked by both the Secretary at War and King George III. It was about this time that the regiment was redesignated the Royal Pembroke Fuzileers (Fusiliers).\n\nIn May 1809 the Royal Pembroke Fusiliers marched to Hastings in Sussex, and then on to Bexhill-on-Sea, where it joined the Welsh Militia Brigade, which also included the Royal Flint and Royal Merioneth Militia. This brigade was dispersed in January 1810 and the regiment , now greatly understrength after supplying numerous volunteers to the line regiments, went to Playden Barracks near Rye and then back to Bristol with a detachment at Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire. The regiment was redesignated the Royal Pembroke Light Infantry on 30 March 1810; as well as a change in training the drums were replaced by bugles and the sergeants' Spontoons by light flintlock fusils.\n\nIreland 1811–12\nIn January 1811 and again in June the regiment, still at Bristol, volunteered to serve in Ireland, or in the Peninsula if required. It embarked for Ireland on 8 September. Meanwhile, on 17 July 1811 it had received another new designation: it was now the Royal Pembrokeshire Rifle Corps (or simply Royal Pembroke Rifles). This entailed a change of uniform and eventually of weaponry, the Baker rifle and sword bayonet replacing the Brown Bess smoothbore musket and socket bayonet.\n\nBy April 1812 the regiment was stationed at Ballinasloe, about  from Athlone. The country was disturbed, with frequent acts of terrorism and attacks on soldiers. In May it moved to Antrim, with half the regiment detached to Carrickfergus. At the end of its tour of duty, the regiment marched to Dundalk about 21 April 1813 and sailed to Liverpool. It then marched back to Pembrokeshire, reaching Haverfordwest on 17 June. It remained there, with a detachment at Milford Haven, for the rest of the war, supplying volunteers to reinforce the regulars. Napoleon abdicated on 6 April 1814, ending the war, and the Royal Pembroke Rifles was disembodied on 24 June. Unlike some other regiments, it was not re-embodied when Napoleon escaped from Elba and initiated the short Waterloo campaign.\n\nLong Peace\nAfter Waterloo there was another long peace. Although officers continued to be commissioned into the militia and ballots were still occasionally held, the regiments were rarely assembled for training (only in 1818, 1821 and 1831) and the permanent staffs of sergeants and drummers were progressively reduced. However, the regimental band remained active, paid for privately by the officers.\n\n1852 Reforms\nThe long-standing national Militia of the United Kingdom was revived by the Militia Act 1852, enacted during a period of international tension. As before, units were raised and administered on a county basis, and filled by voluntary enlistment (although conscription by means of the Militia Ballot might be used if the counties failed to meet their quotas). Training was for 56 days on enlistment, then for 21–28 days per year, during which the men received full army pay. Under the Act, Militia units could be embodied by Royal Proclamation for full-time home defence service in three circumstances:\n 'Whenever a state of war exists between Her Majesty and any foreign power'.\n 'In all cases of invasion or upon imminent danger thereof'.\n 'In all cases of rebellion or insurrection'.\n\nhe 1852 Act introduced Artillery Militia units in addition to the traditional infantry regiments. Their role was to man coastal defences and fortifications, relieving the Royal Artillery (RA) for active service. One of the regiments chosen for conversion to artillery in 1853 was the Royal Pembroke Rifles, which became the Royal Pembroke Artillery Militia. It was given an establishment of 431 all ranks, organised into four batteries, but for several years the numbers recruited were barely half that many.\n\nCrimean War and after\n\nWar having broken out with Russia in 1854 and an expeditionary force sent to the Crimea, the militia began to be called out for home defence. The Royal Monmouth Light Infantry (RMLI) were embodied in May and stationed at Pembroke Dock, where they volunteered for overseas garrison service. The non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and men of the Royal Pembroke Artillery, not yet embodied, made the same offer. The regiment was assembled for its first 28-day training at Haverfordwest on 12 June, but it was not until 30 January 1855 that it was embodied for permanent service, with 200 gunners enrolled, together with a small band of German musicians. The regiment began a period of intensive training in the Milford Haven defences. In August it took over security duties at Pembroke Dock from the Royal Marines, and in August No 1 Company with detachment of the other companies took up duties with the RA on Thorne Island. Work on a fort on this island had begun in 1852, and by 1855 it was armed with nine 68-pounder smoothbore muzzle-loading guns mounted on traversing carriages, sited to created a crossfire with Dale Fort to deny the entrance of the Haven to hostile ships.\n\nJust before Christmas 1855, a severe storm cut Thorne Island off from the mainland and supplies ran out. However, the commanding officer and surgeon of the RMLI at Pembroke Dock chartered a small steamer, and got close enough to throw some supplies onto the landing stage on the island. In April 1856 the other three companies of the Royal Pembroke Artillery moved into Pembroke Dock from Haverfordwest and provided gun detachments to man the gun towers round the Royal Navy Dockyard and other forts around the Haven. It also provide a number of volunteers who transferred to the RA. \n\nThe Treaty of Paris signed on 30 March 1856 brought the war to an end, and in July the Royal Pembroke Artillery returned to Haverfordwest and was disembodied. The regiment returned to the normal system of annual training in 1857. It volunteered for duty in 1858 during the Indian Mutiny but the offer was not taken up.\n\nRoyal Carmarthen and Pembroke Artillery\nIn 1861 the War Office decided to amalgamate the small Welsh county militia contingents into larger regiments. The decision was made to convert the Royal Carmarthen Rifles to artillery and amalgamate it with the understrength Royal Pembroke Artillery. In June 1861 the Royal Carmarthen and Pembroke Artillery Militia came into being. The two contingents retained their HQs and stores at Carmarthen and Haverfordwest, the Pembroke establishment being set at 384 gunners organised into four batteries. Sir Hugh Owen remained joint lt-col-cmdt with Sir James Williams-Drummond, 3rd Baronet, of the Carmarthens. There is no record of the Carmarthen and Pembroke contingents training together. The Pembroke militia quota (384 men) was increased to 436 in 1868, and by that date the enrolled strength was 434. In 1871 the Royal Pembroke Artillery regained its independence and title, with 432 effectives out of a new establishment of 526 men..\n\nRoyal Pembroke Artillery\nThe Militia Reserve introduced in 1867 consisted of present and former militiamen who undertook to serve overseas in case of war. From 1871 the militia came under the War Office rather than their county lords lieutenant. Around a third of the recruits and many young officers went on to join the regular army. Following the Cardwell Reforms a mobilisation scheme began to appear in the Army List from December 1875. This assigned places in an order of battle of the 'Garrison Army' to militia artillery units: the Royal Pembroke Artillery's war station was at Pembroke, including Stack Rock Fort, South Hook Fort, Popton Fort, Fort Hubberstone, West Blockhouse Fort, Thorne Island,  Scoveston Fort, Mumbles (Swansea) and St Catherine's Fort (Tenby).\n\nThe Royal Artillery and Militia Artillery were reorganised on 14 April 1882, when 11 territorial divisions of garrison artillery were formed, each consisting of a number of brigades. In each division the 1st Brigade was composed of Regular RA batteries, the others being a varying number of militia corps. The Royal Pembroke Artillery joined the Welsh Division, becoming 4th Brigade, Welsh Division, RA, with four batteries. (All the militia artillery continued to use their old titles unofficially.) On 1 July 1889 the territorial divisions were reorganised into three large divisions of garrison artillery, the Welsh militia units joining the Western Division and regaining their county titles (without any 'Royal' prefixes, though these were unofficially retained).\n\nIn April 1885 the Pembroke brigade's HQ moved from Haverfordwest to Fort Hubberstone. This had been built in 1863–5 as an addition to the Milford Haven defences. Sited on a headland it commanded excellent views of the entrance to the Haven. It consisted of a defensible barracks with 28 guns and accommodation for 250 men. The original guns were probably 9-inch rifled muzzle-loading (RML) guns, but by 1872 eight RML 7-inch guns on Moncrieff Disappearing Carriages had been added. In 1881 the armament consisted of a number of 10-inch guns in Barbette mountings.\n\nBy 1885 the enrolled strength of the Pembroke Artillery had fallen to 319, 206 short of establishment: moving the HQ  from a town to an isolated coastal fort had a detrimental effect on recruitment, and the unit never again reached full strength. However, the Welsh militia artillery often carried out their annual training at the same time, so the batteries around the Haven could cooperate in live-firing exercises against target vessels, and with the searchlights and defensive mines operated by the Royal Engineers. In May 1894 the Pembroke, Carmarthen, and Cardigan Artillery carried out combined night firing from Hubberstone, Popton and South Hook forts respectively, and the following year all three units trained together at Popton.\n\nThe RA was divided into field and garrison branches in 1899, with all the militia and volunteer units becoming part of the Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA). The RGA's divisional structure was abolished in 1902, when the unit became the Pembroke Royal Garrison Artillery (Militia).\n\nDuring the Second Boer War the Militia Reservists were called out in November 1899 to reinforce the regulars. Then the Pembroke Artillery was embodied from 4 May to 3 October 1900 for home defence. No only did it man Hubberstone Fort, but detachments went to Hakin, Milford Haven and Thorne Island.\n\nDisbandment\nAfter the Boer War, the future of the Militia was called into question. There were moves to reform the Auxiliary Forces (Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteers) to take their place in the six Army Corps proposed by St John Brodrick as Secretary of State for War. Some batteries of militia artillery were to be converted to field artillery. However, little of Brodrick's scheme was carried out.\n\nUnder the sweeping Haldane Reforms of 1908, the Militia was replaced by the Special Reserve, a semi-professional force whose role was to provide reinforcement drafts for regular units serving overseas in wartime. Although all seven officers and 125 out of 184 other ranks of the Pembroke RGA (M) accepted transfer to the Special Reserve Royal Field Artillery, as the Pembroke Royal Field Reserve Artillery on 5 July 1908, it was disbanded on 16 March 1909.\n\nCommanders\nThe following officers commanded the regiment:\n\nCommandants\n Col Sir Thomas Stepney, 5th Baronet, 1697\n Col Sir Hugh Owen, 5th Baronet of Orielton, 1759\n Maj-Cmdt Wyriot Owen, 1779\n Lt-Col-Cmdt John Colby, 2 January 1780, resigned 1800\n Lt-Col Cmdt William Scourfield, promoted April 1800\n Lt-Col Owen Philipps, promoted 2 July 1802\n Lt-Col Sir Hugh Owen Owen, 2nd Baronet, appointed 16 September 1830\n Lt-Col John Owen, promoted 3 March 1875\n Lt-Col Francis Edwardes, promoted 6 October 1888\n Lt-Col W.C. Cope promoted 4 February 1903\n\nHonorary colonels\nThe following served as Honorary Colonel:\n Col George Rice-Trevor, Lord Dynevor, former CO of the Royal Carnarvon Rifles, appointed 12 August 1861, died 7 October 1869\n Col Sir Hugh Owen Owen, 2nd Baronet, appointed 10 February 1875\n Col Francis Edwards, appointed 6 May 1903\n\nHeritage and ceremonial\n\nColours\nWhen the regiment was inspected in 1684 the colour of the Horse Troop's cornet was unrecorded, but it bore a scroll inscribed 'FOR GOD AND THE KING'. In 1759 the regiment carried two Regimental Colours in addition to the King's Colour, a most unusual arrangement. Both of these colours were blue, one carrying the Coat of arms of Pembrokeshire, the other those of Haverfordwest. By 1808 the (single) regimental colour was Garter blue appropriate to a Royal regiment: it bore the Union Flag in the canton canton and in the centre was a Union Wreath of roses, thistles and shamrocks encircling the title 'ROYAL PEMBROKE FUZILIERS' with the Prince of Wales's feathers, coronet and 'ICH DIEN' motto above.The regiment ceased to carry colours when converted to a rifle corps in 1811, and the last pair carried were laid up in St Mary's Church, Haverfordwest, in 1909.\n\nUniforms and insignia\nFrom about 1759 the regiment wore a red uniform with blue facings. When converted to a rifle corps it adopted a Rifle green uniform with black facings similar to the Rifle Brigade. On conversion to artillery in 1852 the regiment adopted the blue uniform with red facings of the RA.  \n\nAbout 1800 the regiment wore a universal Shako plate without regimental distinctions. An officer's Epaulette of about 1811 carries as a badge the Prince of Wales's feathers, coronet and motto with a scroll beneath inscribed 'ROYAL PEMBROKE'. After conversion to artillery, the regiment wore the standard RA helmet plate of the Royal Arms over a gun, the scroll beneath reading 'MILITIA ARTILLERY', changed to 'WELSH DIVISION' in 1882. An embroidered title reading 'WELSH' was worn on both shoulder straps 1882–89. After 1889 the scroll on the helmet plate read 'ROYAL PEMBROKE'. From 1901 the letter 'M' (for Militia) appeared between the gun and the lower scroll. About 1860 the badge on the officers' pouchbelt plate consisted of the Prince of Wales's feathers, coronet and motto inside a crowned garter inscribed 'ROYAL PEMBROKE'. On khaki service dress the brass shoulder title read 'RGA' over 'PEMBROKE' and the cap badge was that of the RA with 'M' between the gun and the scroll. The officers' Field service cap badge was an embroidered 'bomb' over a scroll reading 'ROYAL PEMBROKE'.\n\nPrecedence\nIn 1759 it was ordered that militia regiments on service were to take precedence from the\ndate of their arrival in camp. In 1760 this was altered to a system of drawing lots where regiments did duty together. During the War of American Independence and French Revolutionary War the counties were given an order of precedence determined by ballot each year. However, counties like Pembrokeshire with no more than two companies were ignored. Another ballot for precedence took place in 1803 at the start of the Napoleonic War and remained in force until 1833: Pembrokeshire was 54th. In 1833 the King drew the lots for individual regiments and the resulting list continued in force with minor amendments until 1855. The regiments raised before the peace of 1763 took the first 47 places and the Royal Pembroke Rifles became 28th.\n\nThe first artillery militia units formed were given an order of precedence in 1855 based on alphabetical order: the Royal Pembroke was 24th, which happened to be the same as the Royal Carmarthen's precedence as an infantry regiment. The combined regiment used this precedence 1861–71; after it split the Royal Carmarthen retained the precedence of 24th among artillery militia units but the Royal Pembroke dropped to 31st.\n\nSee also\n Trained Bands\n Militia (English)\n Militia (Great Britain)\n Militia (United Kingdom)\n Welsh Division, Royal Artillery\n Western Division, Royal Artillery\n Royal Carmarthen Artillery\n\nFootnotes\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n W.Y.

        "Gammon Construction Limited is a Hong Kong construction and engineering contractor headquartered in Kwun Tong, Hong Kong. In addition to local construction projects, it is also involved in the construction and engineering of various projects in China and Southeast Asia.\n\nHistory\nThe company originated from a construction business founded in India by John C. Gammon in 1919. In 1955, a branch was engaged to build a new runway at Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong. In 1958, Gammon Construction Limited (\"Gammon\") was formed to establish a permanent presence in Hong Kong.\n\nOnce incorporated in Hong Kong, it grew rapidly, obtaining construction work of a diverse nature.  By the late 1970s, it was established as the leading contractor in Hong Kong, participating in many of the major infrastructure projects of that time. The company began to expand business outside Hong Kong, establishing offices in Singapore and Vietnam.\n\nOwnership\nJardine Matheson took a minority interest in Gammon in 1969 and it became a public company in 1970. Then in 1975, Jardines acquired the remaining shareholding and thus Gammon became a wholly owned subsidiary of Jardines. In late 1983, Jardine Matheson sold 50 percent of Gammon to Trafalgar House, a UK-based company involved in construction, shipping and property.\n\nIn India, Gammon was taken over in 1991 by Abhijit Rajan. In Pakistan, Gammon was taken over by the Bibojee Group. Gammon then became the preferred constructor throughout the Asia-Pacific region for both Jardines and Trafalgar House. In 1996, Kvaerner took over Trafalgar House, thereby acquiring its 50% interest in Gammon. Skanska acquired all of Kvaerner's construction businesses, including Gammon, in late 2000. Balfour Beatty, the international engineering, construction and services group, subsequently purchased Skanska's 50% in Gammon in 2004.\n\nCorporate affairs\nIt has its head office in Kwun Tong. It occupies  of space there. It moved there circa 2019.\n\nPreviously its head office was in TaiKoo Place in Quarry Bay.\n\nNotable projects\nGammon has been involved in the construction of various major projects in Hong Kong and around the region:\n Bukit Panjang LRT line in Singapore completed in 1999 \n Chater House in Central, Hong Kong completed in 2002\n Tseung Kwan O line extension in Hong Kong completed in 2002\n One Peking Road in Kowloon, Hong Kong completed in 2003\n Le Méridien Cyberport in Southern District, Hong Kong completed in 2004\n Three Pacific Place in Admiralty, Hong Kong completed in 2004\n Maintenance depot on the Ma On Shan line in Hong Kong completed in 2004\n The Disneyland Resort line on the Tsing Chau Tsai Peninsula in Hong Kong completed in 2005\n The northern section of the Kong Sham Western Highway completed in 2007\n One Island East in Eastern District, Hong Kong completed in 2008\n Upgrading of the Woodsville Interchange in Singapore completed in 2008\n Nam Wan Tunnel in Hong Kong completed in 2009\n iSQUARE in Kowloon, Hong Kong completed in 2009\n Institute of Technical Education College West Campus in Singapore completed in 2010\n The Downtown section of the Chinatown MRT station in Singapore completed in 2013\n The Cathay Pacific Cargo Terminal at Hong Kong International Airport completed in 2015\n The Midfield Concourse at Hong Kong International Airport completed in 2016\n The northern section of the Hong Kong West Kowloon railway station completed in 2018\n The southern section of the Tuen Mun–Chek Lap Kok Link completed in 2018\n\nThe company is also involved in the construction of the Mayflower MRT station due to be completed in 2021 and Havelock MRT station due to be completed in 2022.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nCompanies formerly listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange\nJardine Matheson Group\nConstruction and civil engineering companies of Hong Kong\nConstruction and civil engineering companies established in 1919\n1919 establishments in Hong Kong",

        "Pan Am Flight 217 was a Boeing 707 that crashed near Caracas, Venezuela while on a flight from New York City, USA on December 12, 1968. Though pilot error was to blame, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded the probable cause was undetermined. There were no survivors.\n\nAircraft and crew \nPan Am Flight 217 was operated by a Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) Boeing 707-321B (registration N494PA, named Clipper Malay). The aircraft was less than a year old — its first flight was on March 7, 1968, and it was delivered to Pan Am on March 28.\n\nThere were nine crew members, including eight from the United States and one from Sweden. The captain was 50 years old and had 24,000 flight hours' experience, including 6,737 hours on the Boeing 707.\n\nAccident description \nThe aircraft took off from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on a scheduled flight to Caracas Simon Bolivar International Airport on December 12, 1968. As the aircraft was nearing Caracas, it disappeared from air traffic control's radar screens. At 22:05 local time, the aircraft crashed into the Caribbean Sea and exploded. At this point, a call was made to the Venezuelan Navy to search for the aircraft. Wreckage of the Boeing 707 was found  from Caracas. All 51 passengers and crew died in the crash.\n\nVarious aircraft and boats, both naval and civilian, were employed in the search and recovery operation. Some reports stated that many bodies were eaten by sharks. The crash was the deadliest aviation disaster to occur in Venezuela up to that point in time, but was surpassed by Viasa Flight 742 in 1969.\n\nNotable passengers \nOne of those who perished in the flight 217 crash was Olga Antonetti, a former Miss Venezuela. Also killed was Rafael Antonio Curra, a Venezuelan ichthyologist and university professor.\n\nAccident cause \n\nThe cause of the crash was believed to be pilot error resulting from an optical illusion, created by the lights of the city of Caracas on an upslope. This may have caused the crew to descend until they crashed into the sea, with the loss of all on board. However, the National Transportation Safety Board stated the probable cause was undetermined.\n\nBook about accident\nThe book The Lost Lives of the Clipper Malay provides details of the aircraft, the accident, and the long process of recovering the bodies of the nine crew members and 42 passengers. The recovery lasted more than a month. The book also provides a biographical account of each of the fifty-one victims.\n\nReferences \n\nAirliner accidents and incidents involving controlled flight into terrain\nPan Am accidents and incidents\nAccidents and incidents involving the Boeing 707\nAviation accidents and incidents in Venezuela\nAviation accidents and incidents in 1968\nDecember 1968 events in South America\nPages with unreviewed translations\n1968 disasters in Venezuela",

        "Pellom McDaniels III (February 21, 1968 – April 19, 2020) was an American professional football player who was a defensive lineman in the National Football League (NFL). After his playing career, he became a professor and curator at Emory University.\n\nEarly life\nMcDaniels was born the first child of Pellom and Mary McDaniels. However, he was raised by his maternal grandparents and later went on to attend Silver Creek High School in San Jose.\n\nCollegiate career\nMcDaniels began his undergraduate studies in Fine Arts at Oregon State University where he experienced success as a student-athlete.  He played defensive end for the Oregon State Beavers.  In his junior season, he had 42 tackles and a team-high 6.5 sacks.  McDaniels earned 2nd team All-Pac-10 honors his senior year after finishing the season with 46 tackles and 4.5 sacks.\n\nProfessional career\nFollowing his collegiate career, McDaniels worked for Procter & Gamble as a Health and Beauty Care representative in the Portland, Oregon area before pursuing a professional football career in the World League of American Football with the Birmingham Fire.  In 1991, McDaniels signed his first contract in the National Football League with the Philadelphia Eagles. After having hip surgery, he spent his recovery time coaching football defensive lineman at Sunset High School in Beaverton, Oregon. Pellom spent his evenings after practice working on his own reconditioning and strength building. He was considered one of the best coaches to have worked at Sunset High according to his students. In 1992, the Kansas City Chiefs asked McDaniels to join the team's practice roster, and from 1993 to 1998, he was a part of the heralded defense that countered NFL offenses throughout the 1990s.\n\nWhile a member of the Kansas City Chiefs Football organization, McDaniels became a voice for Kansas City's children and contributed the resources needed to begin the Arts for Smarts foundation.  Programs like \"Pellom and I Like Art\", Wee Art, the \"Fish Out Water\" Writing program, and Smart Starts were designed to help children and young adults recognize and realize the possibilities for their futures.  After spending two seasons with the Atlanta Falcons, McDaniels retired from the NFL and began his pursuit of a graduate degree at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia where he received both a Master of Arts and a Ph.D. in American Studies.  He was an assistant professor in history at the University of Missouri–Kansas City. He was an assistant professor of African American studies and faculty curator of the African American collection in the Manuscript, Archives, and Rare Book Library at Emory University. In February 2009, McDaniels was a key factor in the creation of an exhibit at the William T. Kemper Foundation Art Gallery commemorating African Americans who had fought in the First World War.\n\nHis publications included: \"The Prince of Jockeys: The Life of Isaac Burns Murphy\" (2013); So, You Want to be Pro (2000), My Own Harlem (1998); \"We're American Too: The Negro Leagues and the Philosophy of Resistance\" in Baseball and Philosophy: Thinking Outside the Batter's Box (2004); reviews in Hampton University's International Review of African American Art related to the work of artists Kadir Nelson and Hale Woodruff.\n\nIn December 2014, McDaniels was announced as one of the six recipients of the 2015 Silver Anniversary Awards, presented annually by the NCAA to outstanding former student-athletes on the 25th anniversary of the end of their college sports careers. The award is based on both athletic and professional success.\n\nHe was an adherent of the Baháʼí Faith, utilizing its teachings and principles to perform acts of service, promote education and value for culture, and engage in community-outreach endeavors.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nPellom McDaniels stats\nTheyCameToFight Exhibition on African Americans in World War I by Pellom McDaniels III\nThe Prince of Jockeys: The Life of Isaac Burns Murphy\nPellom McDaniels\n\n1968 births\n2020 deaths\nAmerican football defensive linemen\nAtlanta Falcons players\nBirmingham Fire players\nKansas City Chiefs players\nPlayers of American football from San Jose, California\nOregon State Beavers football players\nUniversity of Missouri–Kansas City faculty\nWriters from San Jose, California\nAmerican Bahá'ís\nNeurological disease deaths in Georgia (U.S. state)\nSilver Creek High School (California) alumni",

        "The Commandant of Cadets is a named organization of the United States Air Force based at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Until August 2006 the commander of the 34th Training Wing was \"dual-hatted\" as the Commandant of Cadets at the Academy.  In that month the 34th Wing became a named organization.\n\nThe organization was first activated in 1941 as the 34th Bombardment Group.  Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the group briefly participated in antisubmarine patrols.  During most of 1942 and 1943, the group acted as a heavy bomber training unit.  In early 1944, the unit began preparations to move overseas.  It served with Eighth Air Force in England, from April 1944 until the end of the war, converting form the Consolidated B-24 Liberator to the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress in the middle of combat operations. It returned to the United States after VE Day and was inactivated in August 1945.\n\nThe 34th Tactical Group was activated in the early days of American participation in the Vietnam War.  It trained Republic of Vietnam Air Force airmen and engaged in combat operations and the operational testing of weapons and munitions until 1965, when the increasing American involvement in Vietnam caused it to be replaced by the larger 6251st Tactical Fighter Wing.\n\nIn 1984 the 34th Bombardment Group and the 34th Tactical Group were consolidated into a single unit.  The consolidated unit was redesignated the 34th Training Wing  and activated in October 1994 at the United States Air Force Academy, where it has served the Commandant of Cadets as the military training arm of the academy.\n\nMission\nThe mission of the Commandant of Cadets is to educate and train potential United States Air Force officers as the administrative organization responsible for cadet leadership and military training programs, instruction in military and airmanship courses, and general supervision of cadet life activities.\n\nHistory\n\nWorld War II\n\nThe group was first activated at Langley Field, Virginia in January 1941 as the 34th Bombardment Group and equipped with a mixture of B-17C and B-17D Flying Fortresses and Douglas B-18 Bolos. Its original squadrons were the 4th, 7th, and 18th Bombardment Squadrons, while the 1st Reconnaissance Squadron)\nwas initially assigned to General Headquarters Air Force, but attached to the 34th Bombardment Group. The 34th Group moved to Westover Field, Massachusetts four months after it was activated.\n\nAfter the Pearl Harbor attack the group began antisubmarine patrols off the Northeast coast of the United States, but soon became part of Western Defense Command and moved to Pendleton Field, Oregon.  By the summer of 1942, Second Air Force had become primarily a heavy bomber training force and the group became a B-17 Replacement Training Unit (RTU) at Geiger Field. RTUs were oversized units which trained aircrews prior to their deployment to combat theaters.\n\nOn 15 December 1942 the group moved to Blythe Army Air Base, California a base of the Desert Training Center. The 34th provided cadres for a number of heavy bomber groups that served with Eighth Air Force during this period.\n\nThe 34th began training with Consolidated B-24 Liberators for overseas combat operations on 5 January 1944. The ground echelon moved to the port of embarkation on 1 April 1944, while the air echelon began its overseas movement on 31 May 1944, taking the southern ferry route, from Florida to Trinidad, Brazil, West Africa and Marrakesh, arriving at RAF Valley, Wales. The group arrived at its permanent station, RAF Mendlesham, England, in April 1944 and entered combat on 23 May 1944.\n\nThe 34th flew 170 operations from Mendlesham, the first sixty-two while flying B-24H and B-24J Liberators and the remainder with B-17G Flying Fortresses. The group helped to prepare for Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy, by bombing airfields in France and Germany, and supported the June landings by attacking coastal defenses and communications. It supported ground forces at Saint-Lô in late July and struck V-1 flying bomb launch sites, gun emplacements, and supply lines throughout the summer of 1944.\n\nThe mixture of B-24s and B-17s in the 3d Bombardment Division presented a number of operational problems, and in early 1944 plans had begun at VIII Bomber Command headquarters to standardize the division with the Flying Fortress. The group flew its last B-24 mission on 24 August 1944. It transferred its Liberators for overhaul and eventual transfer to units of the 2d Bombardment Division, and began converting to B-17s and flew its first mission with the new planes on 17 September 1944. The 34th engaged primarily in bombardment of strategic objectives from October 1944 to February 1945. Targets included marshalling yards in Ludwigshafen, Hamm, Osnabrück, and Darmstadt; oil centers in Bielefeld, Merseburg, Hamburg, and Misburg; factories in Berlin, Dalteln, and Hanover; and airfields in Münster, Neumünster, and Frankfurt.\n\nDuring this period the group also supported ground forces during the Battle of the Bulge from December 1944 to January 1945. In March 1945, with few enemy industrial targets remaining and with Allied armies advancing across Germany, the 34th turned almost solely to interdicting enemy communications and supporting Allied ground forces. As training programs in the States accelerated, replacement crews arriving later in the war tended to be younger than those arriving earlier.  One 34th crew, that of 2d Lt Joe Novick, was claimed to be the youngest in VIII Bomber Command.  Lt Novicki was the \"old man\" at 21 and all other crew members were 19 or 20 years old in 1945. The 34th flew its last combat mission on 20 April 1945.\n\nAfter V-E Day the group flew six missions carrying food to flooded areas of the Netherlands and transported prisoners of war from German camps to Allied centers. The group redeployed to the United States in June and July 1945. The first elements of the air echelon departed 19 June 1945. The ground echelon sailed aboard the  from Southampton on 6 August 1945. Upon arrival in the states, group personnel were given 30 days leave. The group reassembled at Sioux Falls Army Air Field, South Dakota, where it was inactivated on 28 August 1945.\n\nVietnam War\n\nThe 34th Tactical Group was activated in July 1963 to train Republic of Vietnam Air Force (VNAF) personnel in counter-insurgency operations. It trained VNAF strike pilots, forward air controllers, and observers.  Its initial squadrons were the 1st Air Commando Squadron, a composite unit flying Douglas B-26 Invaders at first, and the 19th Tactical Air Support Squadron, equipped with Cessna O-1 Bird Dogs. Later, the 1st also operated Helio U-10 Couriers, North American T-28 Trojans and Douglas C-47 Skytrains. The Air Force intended to turn the 19th's Bird Dogs over to the VNAF, and the squadron was inactivated in August 1964.  However, the Gulf of Tonkin incident altered these plans and the squadron was activated again in October. The squadron's forward air controllers became more critical as the war expanded into populated areas and it became necessary to minimize civilian casualties.\n\nPlans had also been made to withdraw the 1st Air Commando Squadron and transfer its aircraft to the VNAF after replacing its AT-28s and B-26s with A-1Hs, but these plans were cancelled. Due to age and hard use in combat, two AT-28s lost their wings and crashed in March and April 1964, while in June all B-26s were grounded. The 1st only remained operational by borrowing nine T-28Bs from the VNAF. These incidents confirmed the plan to convert the squadron's attack aircraft to the Douglas A-1 Skyraider\n\nThe 34th also flew combat missions, including close air support, fighter escort and interdiction, psychological warfare, aerial supply, forward air control and tactical liaison. It pioneered tactical weapons and munitions, such as the minigun, the daisycutter, and the gunship. In the fall of 1964, the 602d Fighter Squadron (Commando) was activated and assigned to the group. The Skyraider became the primary strike aircraft of the 1st and 602d Squadrons from this time.\n\nThe group controlled its first jet aircraft in 1964 when Martin B-57 Canberras of the 8th and 13th Bombardment Squadrons, stationed at Clark Air Base in the Philippines began to rotate to Bien Hoa, where they were attached to the group for operations. These were the first USAF jets in Viet Nam.  Prior to the passage of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, the United States had interpreted the Geneva Accords as prohibiting jet combat aircraft from former French Indochina. On the night of 1 November, Viet Cong located just outside the perimeter of Bien Hoa attacked the base with mortars, destroying five B-57s and damaging an additional 15.\n\nAircrews of the 1st Air Commando Squadron performed the first combat tests of the FC-47 (later Douglas AC-47 Spooky) gunship beginning in December 1964. As more Air Force units moved to Bien Hoa, the 6251st Tactical Fighter Wing replaced the group in July 1965, and the 34th was inactivated.\n\nCadet training\n\nIn September 1985, the 34th Bombardment Group and the 34th Tactical Group were consolidated into a single unit.  In late 1994, the consolidated unit was redesignated the 34th Training Wing and activated with two assigned groups as the administrative organization responsible for cadet leadership and military training programs under the supervision of the Commandant of Cadets at the United States Air Force Academy. It is responsible for instruction in military and general supervision of cadet life activities.  Until October 2004 it also provided airmanship courses. Its 34th Operations Group was inactivated in 2004 and its airmanship training mission became the responsibility of the 306th Flying Training Group of Air Education and Training Command.  In 2006, it reorganized and its 34th Education Group was inactivated and replaced by four Cadet Groups.\n\nLineage\n 34th Bombardment Group\n Established as the 34th Bombardment Group (Heavy) on 20 November 1940\n Activated on 15 January 1941\n Redesignated 34th Bombardment Group, c. 15 February 1944\n Inactivated on 28 August 1945\n Consolidated with the 34th Tactical Group as the 34th Tactical Group on 31 January 1984\n\n 34th Training Wing\n Established as the 34th Tactical Group and activated, on 19 June 1963 (not organized)\n Organized on 8 July 1963\n Discontinued and inactivated on 8 July 1965\n Consolidated with the 34th Bombardment Group on 31 January 1984\n\n Consolidated unit\n Redesignated 34th Training Wing on 30 September 1994\n Activated on 31 October 1994\n Redesignated Commandant of Cadets on 30 August 2006\n\nAssignments\n\n 2d Bombardment Wing, 15 January 1941\n 4th Bombardment Wing, 3 June 1941\n I Bomber Command, 5 September 1941\n 2d (later, Second) Air Force, 27 January 1942\n 16th Bombardment Training Wing (later, 16 Bombardment Operational Training Wing), c. 15 December 1942\n 93d Combat Bombardment Wing, c. 26 April 1944\n\n 45th Combat Bombardment Wing, 24 May 1945\n 20th Bombardment Wing, 18 June – 28 August 1945\n Pacific Air Forces, 19 June 1963 (not organized)\n 2d Air Division, 8 July 1963 – 8 July 1965\n United States Air Force Academy, 31 October 1994 – present\n\nComponents\nGroups\n 34th Operations Group: 31 October 1994 – 4 October 2004\n 34th Education Group: 7 November 1994 – 1 August 2006\n 1st Cadet Group: 1 August 2006 – present\n 2d Cadet Group: 1 August 2006 – present\n 3d Cadet Group: 1 August 2006 – present\n 4th Cadet Group: 1 August 2006 – present\n\nSquadrons\n 1st Reconnaissance (Squadron later 391st Bombardment Squadron): attached 15 January 1941 – 24 February 1942, assigned 25 February 1942 – 28 August 1945\n 1st Air Commando Squadron: 8 July 1963 – 8 July 1965\n 4th Bombardment Squadron: 15 January 1941 – 28 August 1945\n 7th Bombardment Squadron: 15 January 1941 – 28 August 1945\n 8th Bombardment Squadron: attached 5 August – 3 November 1964\n 13th Bombardment Squadron: attached 5 August – 3 November 1964; 17 February – 16 May 1965\n 18th Bombardment Squadron: 15 January 1941 – 28 August 1945\n 19th Tactical Air Support Squadron: 8 July 1963 – 8 August 1964; 21 October 1964 – 8 July 1965\n 602d Fighter Squadron (Commando): 18 October 1964 – 8 July 1965\n\nStations\n\n Langley Field, Virginia, 15 January 1941\n Westover Field, Massachusetts, 29 May 1941\n Pendleton Field, Oregon, 27 January 1942\n Davis-Monthan Field, Arizona, 13 May 1942\n Geiger Field, Washington, 4 July 1942\n Ephrata Army Air Base, Washington, 1 December 1942\n\n Bishop Army Air Field, California, 15 December 1942 – April 1944\n RAF Mendlesham (USAAF Station 156), England, 26 April 1944-c. 25 July 1945\n Sioux Falls Army Air Field, South Dakota, Aug-28 August 1945\n Bien Hoa Air Base, South Vietnam, 8 July 1963 – 8 July 1965\n United States Air Force Academy, Colorado, 31 October 1994 – present\n\nAircraft\n\n Boeing B-17C Flying Fortress (1941–1942)\n Boeing B-17D Flying Fortress (1941–1942)\n Boeing B-17G Flying Fortress (1944–1945)\n Douglas B-18 Bolo (1941)\n Consolidated B-24H Liberator (1942–1944)\n Consolidated B-24J Liberator (1942–1944)\n Douglas B-26 Invader (1963–1964)\n Martin B-57 Canberra (1964–1965)\n Cessna O-1 Bird Dog (1963–1965)\n Helio U-10 Courier (1963–1965)\n North American T-28 Trojan (1963–1964)\n Douglas C-47 Skytrain (1963–1965)\n Douglas AC-47 Spooky (1964–1965)\n Douglas A-1 Skyraider (1964–1965)\n Cessna T-41 Mescalero, (1994–2004)\n Cessna T-51, (1995–2004)\n de Havilland Canada UV-18 Twin Otter (1994–2004)\n\nAwards and campaigns\n\nSee also\n\n Commandant of Cadets of the United States Air Force Academy\n B-17 Flying Fortress units of the United States Army Air Forces\n B-24 Liberator units of the United States Army Air Forces\n List of B-57 units of the United States Air Force\n List of Douglas A-1 Skyraider operators\n List of Douglas A-26 Invader operators\n List of Douglas C-47 Skytrain operators\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n\n Further reading\n Freeman, Roger A.

        "\"Chasing Pirates\" is the first single by American singer Norah Jones from her fourth album, The Fall. It was released exclusively to iTunes on Tuesday, October 13, 2009.  The song also had its North American radio station premiere on the defunct 97.3 EZ Rock, now CHBM, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on October 9, 2009.  The song went top ten in Japan, The Netherlands and Belgium.  In the US, \"Chasing Pirates\" peaked at No. 13 on Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks and No. 7 on Jazz Songs.\n\n\"Chasing Pirates\" was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards, becoming Jones's third nomination, after \"Don't Know Why\" and \"Sunrise\".\n\nBackground \nNorah Jones explained how \"Chasing Pirates\" came to be, \"About a year ago, I did some demos in my home studio. I had some friends come in and we figured out a cool arrangement for 'Chasing Pirates,' with a cool drum part. It went somewhere I didn't expect it to go, and that became a direction to look in.\"\n\nMusic video \nOctober 27, 2009 VH1 aired the full version of Norah Jones's \"Chasing Pirates\" music video directed by Rich Lee.\nIn the beginning of the music video, she finds a map of Manhattan in a bottle while sitting on the couch in an apartment complex. In the next scene of the music video, she steers a building from a roof made to look like a pirate ship as she tries to find what is marked on the map. She also sits on deck before the roof transforms into a pirate ship. The music video also gained significant airplay on Australia's channel GO as filler time between programs in late 2009 and early 2010.\n\nPerformances \nShe performed the song live on ABC's Dancing with the Stars on October 20, as well as Late Show with David Letterman on November 11, 2009, Good Morning America on November 16, 2009, The View on November 23, 2009, The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien on December 15, 2009 and\nJimmy Kimmel Live!\n\nChart positions\nThe song entered the Adult Album Alternative charts on October 21, 2009 at #13. It became the highest entry by a female artist on that chart since Alanis Morissette's \"Everything\" in 2004.

        "Joseph Henry Tayler (February 7, 1859May 25, 1959) was an American banker and Republican politician from the U.S. state of Wisconsin.  He was the 29th mayor of Green Bay, Wisconsin, and the 9th mayor of Fort Howard, Wisconsin.  In 1932, he was one of several bank officers criminally charged for embezzlement and participating in a fraud to conceal the financial condition of the McCartney National Bank of —he ultimately served four years in federal prison.  His name was frequently abbreviated as J. H. Tayler, and his last name is often misspelled Taylor.\n\nEarly life and career\nJoseph Tayler was born in Fort Howard, Wisconsin, on February 7, 1859.  He lived nearly his entire life in this area, and Fort Howard was absorbed into the city of Green Bay in 1895.  During his youth, his father was postmaster at Fort Howard, and he began his working life as an assistant postmaster to his father—working in that capacity for ten years.  During this time, he also served two years as city treasurer, an office that his father also held at one time.\n\nIn 1881, he went into business with David McCartney in forming the McCartney Exchange Bank.  McCartney was president of the bank and Tayler served as comptroller.  This organization continued until they re-incorporated as the McCartney National Bank, with the same officers, in 1892.  Tayler remained affiliated as an officer of the McCartney National Bank for nearly 50 years, during which time he also served as an officer of the Farmers' and Traders' Bank of Wrightstown.  He also became a director of the Fort Howard Water Works Company in the 1890s, which supplied drinking water to the city.\n\nPolitical career\n\nThroughout his business career, Tayler was active in local politics with the Republican Party of Wisconsin.  He was elected to two consecutive terms as mayor of Fort Howard in 1889 and 1890.  Fort Howard was absorbed into the city of Green Bay in 1895, and Tayler was subsequently elected to a two-year term as mayor of Green Bay in 1902, defeating the incumbent mayor Simon J. Murphy, Jr.  Tayler did not run for re-election in 1904.\n\nEmbezzlement charges\n\nIn the midst of the Great Depression, by 1931, Tayler had served as an officer of the McCartney National Bank for nearly 50 years, had recently ended a term as president of the bank, and was then serving as chairman of the board.  His long-time colleague George A. Richardson had been elected president of the bank in January of that year.  Richardson suddenly committed suicide four months later, on May 21, 1931.  A week later the bank failed and was placed under the authority of federal bank regulators.\n\nAs the bank's books were examined, attention fell on the officers, several of whom were eventually indicted.  Tayler was charged by the federal government that he embezzled at least $600,000 from the bank for himself and for companies he was invested in.  He was arrested from a hospital bed in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, where doctors claimed he was suffering from a heart lesion.\n\nTayler was ultimately convicted and sentenced to ten years in federal prison.  He served four years in Leavenworth before being paroled in 1936.\n\nHe returned to Green Bay and obtained employment as a bookkeeper for a grocery business, where he worked until age 93.\n\nPersonal life and family\n\nJ.

        "Aldershot railway station is located near the town centre of Aldershot in Hampshire, England. It is  down the line from . It is on the Alton Line, part of the National Rail network, with train services and station facilities provided by South Western Railway.\n\nIt has the three-letter code AHT. The station's National Location Code (NLC) is 5623.\n\nHistory\n\nThe London and South Western Railway opened the station in 1870. It became part of the Southern Railway in the 1923 Grouping. The station then passed to the Southern Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948.\n\nNetwork SouthEast operated and served the station after British Rail Sectorised itself in 1982. South West Trains has operated and served the station since the Privatisation of British Railways in 1996.\n\nServices\nTrain destinations are normally , , ,  and .\n\nTrains are usually routed to London Waterloo via  with three services in the morning peak scheduled to go the longer slower route via Ascot (included as part of the normal Aldershot to Ascot service) and two returning via this route in the evening.\n\nThe typical off-peak service (Monday to Saturday) from the station is:\n 2 trains per hour to London Waterloo,\n 2 trains per hour to Alton,\n 2 trains per hour to Guildford,\n 2 trains per hour to Ascot,\n 4 trains per hour to Farnham.\n\nTicket machines\n\nThere are two new TicketXpress ticket vending machines which now reside outside the entrance to the booking hall, making them accessible when the station booking hall is closed.  They are available at all times, except when remotely disabled when there is no service, such as at Christmas. These new machines sell tickets to many stations in Great Britain and accept major credit and debit cards.\n\nThe QuickFare self-service ticket machine (removed October 2006) accepted coins and banknotes and issued tickets to a variety of local destinations, as well as issuing tickets for the station car park. Discounts were available for holders of most Railcards. QuickFare ticket machines were used by British Rail and the Train Companies for many years, providing easy access to tickets at unstaffed stations and at times when ticket offices were closed.\n\nThe QuickFare ticket machine at Aldershot station was inside the booking hall on platform one.  \nThe place where it once stood is now occupied by the \"scu\" (the control centre that operates the new gateline).\n\nRolling stock\n\nServices are mainly run using a four, eight or twelve car Class 450 and 2 cycles can be carried per train.\nClass 444 Desiro five-car units are seen from time to time.\n\nUp to 2005, ex-British Rail slam-door EMUs were used on the Alton Line, many of which were berthed at the carriage sidings south of Farnham station. The carriage shed at Farnham was built in 1937 around the time that the line was electrified.\n\nThe most commonly operated EMUs in recent years were Class 411, Class 421 and Class 423 units. These trains were withdrawn in 2005, except for a very few that were transferred to the Lymington Branch.\n\nPlatforms\n\nThe station has three platforms. The station entrance and ticket office is by Platform 1, which is served by trains towards Woking and London Waterloo. Tracks by Platforms 2 and 3 are signalled for bi-directional operation; these are generally served by Alton-bound and Ascot-bound trains respectively.\n\nPlatforms 2 and 3 are reached by way of the original subway and a more recent covered footbridge. Lifts are incorporated into the footbridge for disabled access.\n\nLocal features\n\nAs trains approach Farnham to the south, the mileage suddenly jumps to a higher one. This is because mileages between the site of Farnham Junction (by the electric substation just before the A31 flyover bridge) and  (the end of the line that formerly continued to Winchester) are reckoned from  via  and the now closed line via  and . The line from Waterloo via  and Aldershot was built significantly later than that via  and .\n\nAbout 450m north-east of the station (towards Ash and can be seen from near the end of platform 1) is Aldershot Railway Tunnel, also known as Redan Hill Tunnel. It is 76 yards long.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n \n \n \n Station on navigable Ordnance Survey map\n List of Railway Tunnels\n\nExternal links\n\nBuildings and structures in Aldershot\nFormer London and South Western Railway stations\nRailway stations in Hampshire\nDfT Category C2 stations\nRailway stations in Great Britain opened in 1870\nRailway stations served by South Western Railway\n1870 establishments in England",

        "A narco-submarine (also called a drug sub or narco sub) is a type of custom ocean-going, self-propelled, semi-submersible or fully-submersible vessel built for smugglers.\n\nNewer semi-submersibles are \"nearly-fully\" submersible in order to reduce likelihood of detection by visual, radar, sonar, or infrared systems. Cargo capacity varies widely with vessel size, although several tons is typical. In 2015, the largest-known cargo of  was seized on a semi-submersible craft. Some contemporary narco-subs are capable of crossing the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nHistory \nDuring the 1980s, go-fast boats were the smuggling vessel of choice in many parts of the world. Go-fast boats became more vulnerable to radar detection as radar technology improved, leading to the development of semi-submersibles.\n\nIn 1988, an unmanned  submarine was found off Boca Raton, Florida. It was designed to be towed by a boat and submerged by remote control. The sub was empty, but officials and authorities believe it was for smuggling after it was realized the hatch could be opened only from the outside.\n\n2000s \nIn 2006 a submarine was seized  southwest of Costa Rica. The U.S. Coast Guard dubbed it Bigfoot because they heard rumors of their existence, but never saw any. In 2006, the U.S. detected three vessels in total, and they estimated between twenty-five to forty semi-subs departed from South America in 2007.  During the first six months of 2008, the U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Navy detected forty-two subs off the coasts of Central America, but few seizures resulted. According to various press-releases, the projected eighty-five narco submarine voyages by the end of 2008 could potentially bring about 544 tons of cocaine to U.S. customers. In 2008, the Mexican Navy intercepted a  submarine in international waters about  southwest of Oaxaca. Mexican Navy Special Forces rappelled from a helicopter on to its deck and arrested four smugglers. According to one press-release, the vessel carried 5.3 tons of cocaine; it was towed to Huatulco, Oaxaca, by a Mexican Navy patrol boat. Also in 2008, the U.S. Coast Guard captured a semi-submersible vessel in international waters about  west of Guatemala; it was carrying an even seven tons of cocaine. The  steel/fiberglass vessel was detected by a U.S. Navy aircraft as part of Operation Panama Express, and was intercepted by Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment 402 aboard USS McInerney. Five days later, an  semi-submersible was seized in international waters by the U.S. Coast Guard Midgett about  south of Guatemala. Several other submarines were intercepted, but not seized because their crews scuttled them upon interception.\n\nIn 2009, the U.S. detected \"as many as sixty\" submarine related events, and calculated they were moving as much as a ton of cocaine daily. In the same year, three submarines were seized on the shores of the Pacific coast, loaded with 1.5 tons of cocaine. The Colombian navy had intercepted or discovered thirty-three submarines by 2009.\n\n2010s \nAfter the November 5, 2010 arrest of Harold Mauricio Poveda, a key Mexican–Colombian link, exigent interrogation methods revealed FARC (the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) were behind the construction of submarines and were collaborating with the Sinaloa Cartel to fund their activities.\n\nIn 2012, United States Coast Guard officials expressed concerns such vessels could potentially be used for terrorism.\n\nIn 2015, the largest recorded seizure was after a cargo of  was seized on a semi-submersible by .\n\nIn 2016, the U.S. Coast Guard seized a semi-submersible in international waters about 300 miles west of Panama, carrying about 6 tons of cocaine with a street value of about $200 million to U.S. customers.\n\nIn 2017, the U.S. Coast Guard detained a semi-submersible off the coast of Texas carrying  of cocaine, and on 13 November the US Coast Guard located and seized another one off the coast of Panama.\n\nIn 2019, Spanish authorities apprehended a 20 m semi-submersible off Galicia, containing 3,000 kg of cocaine, in the first known incident of a submarine crossing the Atlantic Ocean. Operation Black Tide: The Suicidal Journey, a book from author Javier Romero, is a detailed narrative of the enterprise. Amazon Prime Video has made Romero's book into both a television documentary account of the voyage and a drama serial, released in February and March 2022.\n\nA submarine was captured by the Peruvian Navy on 8 December 2019 carrying over 2,000 kg of cocaine off of the coast of the Department of Piura.\n\n2020s\nAccording to a press-release, on November 5, 2020, a submarine was seized in Colombia. A further interception was made in October 2021 by the Ecuadorian naval training ship the Guayas in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe drug trafficker Laureano Oubiña affirmed the existence of a marine cemetery of narco-submarines near the Canary Islands (Spain).\n\nTypes of vessels\nEach vessel can cost upwards of two million dollars to construct, submarines can move enough cocaine in a single trip to generate more than US$100 million in illicit proceeds for the traffickers.\n\nSemi-submersible \n\nColombia's Pacific coastline is filled with thick jungles and waterways, which can be used as clandestine shipyards. A Colombian Navy Commander stated that it is most striking to notice the logistical capacity required of these criminals in order to take all the material into the heart of the jungle, including heavy equipment such as propulsion gear and generators. Some vessels are put together in pieces and then reassembled in other locations under the jungle canopy, in camps outfitted with sleeping quarters for workers. The narco-submarines can cost about $2 million USD and take upward of a year to build. Despite the costs, some of the craft are intended for one-time use, being abandoned at sea after a successful delivery, given that their cargoes carry a street value of up to $400 million. On other seized craft however, officials found zinc bars used as sacrificial anodes, reducing corrosion on metal parts exposed to seawater. As corrosion would not be a concern on a single trip, but would affect long-term durability, this is an indication that the vessel was intended to be used for multiple voyages.\n\nThe design and manufacturing techniques employed in their construction have improved over time: the boats have become faster, more seaworthy, and of higher capacity. An  long narco-submarine can reach speeds of  and carry up to 10 tons of cocaine. They are typically made of fiberglass, powered by a 225–260 kW diesel engine and manned by a crew of four. They have enough cargo space to carry two to ten tons of cocaine, carry large fuel tanks which give them a range of , and are equipped with satellite navigation systems and long-range HF-SSB radio communications capabilities. There is no head (toilet), and accommodation is cramped.\n\nBecause much of its structure is fiberglass and it travels barely under the surface, the vessel is nearly impossible to detect via sonar or radar, and very difficult to spot visually. The newer models pipe their exhaust along the bottom of the hull to cool it before venting it, making the boat even less susceptible to infrared detection. They are most easily spotted visually from the air, though even that is difficult as they are camouflaged with blue paint and produce almost no wake. They have ballast tanks to alter the vessel's buoyancy so that they ride low in the water.\n\nTypical characteristics\nThese are the typical characteristics as stated by the U.S. Joint Interagency Task Force South:\nHull material: wood, fiberglass, or steel\nLength 12–24 m\nFreeboard 0.5 m\nEngines: single or twin diesel\nFuel capacity: 5.6 cubic metres\nRange: 3200 kilometers\nSpeed: 11 km/h or more\nCrew: 4\nCapacity 4–12 metric tons\nControl: human or remote\n\nTrue submarines \n\nNarco-submarines were considered by officials to be an oddity until 2000, when Colombian police discovered what was reported to be a half-built 36 m-long true submarine in a warehouse outside Bogotá. The double-hulled steel vessel could have traveled 3,700 kilometers, dived 100 m, and could have carried about 15 tonnes of cocaine.\n\nOn 3 July 2010 the Ecuadorian authorities seized a fully functional, completely submersible diesel-electric submarine in the jungles bordering Ecuador and Colombia. It had a cylindrical fiberglass and Kevlar hull  long, a  conning tower with periscope, and air conditioning. The vessel had the capacity for about 10 tonnes of cargo, a crew of five or six people, the ability to fully submerge down to , and the capacity for long-range underwater operation. Ecuadorean authorities seized the vessel before its maiden voyage.\n\nOn 14 February 2011 another submarine was seized by the Colombian navy. The 31 m-long fiberglass and Kevlar vessel was found hidden in a jungle area in Timbiquí, in south-western Colombia. It was capable of travelling  below water and it could carry four people and up to 8 tonnes of cargo.\n\nTorpedo \nIn August 2005, authorities discovered an unmanned semi-submersible in the Pacific Ocean, a \"torpedo-style cargo container\" (instead of a full-featured self-propelled ship). These versions use a ballast tank (submersion control) to keep them at about  under water while towed by a fishing vessel. If a patrol ship is spotted, the \"torpedo\" cargo container is released. While submerged, it automatically releases a buoy concealed as a wooden log so it would be mistaken for marine debris. This log-buoy is equipped with a location transmitter system so coworkers can retrieve the torpedo after the vessel and her crew are released by authorities. If the original vessel was detained or otherwise unable to retrieve the cargo torpedo, the location transmission system also allowed for a second support fishing vessel to retrieve it and then continue the delivery. Such a log-buoy was designed to be used as a last resort; risks are involved with the deployment of said buoy:\n authorities could investigate the sudden appearance of 'marine debris'.\n authorities could notice signals from the buoy's transmission systems, then attempt to locate such signal(s). Therefore, crews in the towing boat operate under the guise of a fishing vessel to avoid suspicion, and avoiding the risks of deploying the log-buoy.\n\nThe buoy contains a mechanism to temporarily raise then lower its antenna to transmit its coordinates in encrypted form at irregular intervals. Encrypted codes are used in case of signal interception. Such an encryption could, at a minimum, delay authorities in their attempt to reach the cargo, allowing the narco-traffickers to reach it first. This system evolved from existing buoys used on fishing nets. The buoy designers claim a near 100% shipment delivery success, and state the \"torpedo\" development is evolving into remote-control using encrypted signals transmitted via satellite.\n\nOperations\n\nOperators \n\n Clan del Golfo\n National Liberation Army (ELN)\n Oliver Sinisterra Front\n Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)\n Sinaloa Cartel\n\nRoutes \nSimilar to most coastlines, the western Colombian shore is ideal for smuggling. About a third of the two tons of cocaine coming out of Colombia each day leaves via the Pacific coast in semi-submersibles. Homeland Security estimate submarines carry one-third of smuggled maritime goods to United States customers, while claiming they \"are clueless\" about the rest.\n\nElsewhere, the U.S. Coast Guard say smugglers are evolving complete logistics:\n fishing vessels along the way warn the crews against patrols, and\n provide them with refreshments, while\n offshore refueling vessels provide unlimited loiter time so smugglers can avoid coastal areas.\nFor smugglers, the trips are worth the investment—a nine-ton load earns nearly US$200 million wholesale from U.S. customers. Professional fishermen are often at the controls and earn about US$3,000 after completing the excursion.\n\nSubmarine smugglers unload their cargo onto fast-boats for the final leg to shore. According to press-releases, none of the submarines are known to unload at North American ports or beaches.\n\nIn 2006, a  sub was discovered on the north coast of Spain, but its use is unknown.\n\nIn March 2006, according to a press release, the Calabrian Mafia ('Ndrangheta) ordered a shipment of nine tons of cocaine to be transported by a narco-submarine from Colombia to Italy, but according to a countering press release, the vessel was discovered by Colombian and Italian police during construction.\n\nCountermeasures\n\nSurveillance \nIn 2007, the U.S. Coast Guard adjusted their underwater acoustic sensors to listen for submarines. According to a 2019 press-release, the U.S. Coast Guard reports they capture 11% of submarines.\n\nLegal \nIf various militaries attempt to seize the semi-submersibles in international waters, the crews usually scuttle them. Until 2008, in accordance with international maritime law, the crew was rescued, and, if there was no evidence of wrongdoing, released. To address this loophole, the US Drug Trafficking Vessel Interdiction Act in September 2008 made it a \"felony for those who knowingly or intentionally operate or embark in a self-propelled semi-submersible (SPSS) without nationality and that is or ever navigated international waters, with the intent to evade detection\". The penalty is a prison term of up to twenty years in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. law does not apply to flagged vessels (i.e., registered with some officially recognized government). The bill grants extraterritorial jurisdiction over international waters and makes it illegal to lack relevant documents. Instead of an anti-narcotics operation turning into a rescue mission after submarines are sunk, the crew can be detained and interrogated using 'exigent methods'.\n\nIn 2009, Colombia's Congress passed a law punishing builders of semi-submersible vessels with up to 12 years in prison, or 14 years if they are used to transport drugs.\n\nSecurity issues related to \"torpedo-style cargo containers\", semi-submersible vessels, and submarines were reviewed in an August 2012 article in the US publication Homeland Security Affairs.\n\nSee also \n\n Anti-submarine warfare\n Illegal drug trade\n Illegal drug trade in Colombia\n Merchant submarine\n Mérida Initiative\n Mexican Drug War\n Narco tank\n Plan Colombia\n Prohibition of drugs\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\"Ayer Médico, Hoy Narco – El Mexicano que Quizo ser Pablo Escobar\" (In Spanish) Author: Miguel Angel Montoya.

        "Lambe Alabakovski (, ; born 15 November 1987, in Ljubojno, SFR Yugoslavia) is a Macedonian singer.\n\nBiography\nAlabakovski attended the Euro-College in Kumanovo. He won the M2 Production's Play: Search For A New Star 2004. He made it to the finals and performed the hit \"Spasi Me\" (\"Save Me\"), composed by Darko Dimitrov and won by the televoting audience. Alabakovski was signed to the M2 Production's label. In 2005, Alabakovski recorded his next single, \"Kade Pesno Moja\" (\"Where, My Song\"), a cover of a song by Slave Dimitrov, which was the first Macedonian song to be sold as an internet download. \n\nIn 2005, Alabakovski, along with former M2 colleague, Aleksandra Pileva, traveled to Braşov, Romania to participate in the Golden Stag Festival. He performed his Macedonian hit \"Kade Pesno Moja\" and a Romanian song called \"Dragostea Mea\". Later that year in October, he took part in the annual Macedonia festival, Makfest 2005, where he promoted his new song \"Eh Da Mozam\" (\"If I Could\"). During the holidays, Alabakovski released another single called \"Kazano E Sè\" (\"Everything is Said\").\n\nDuring February 2006, Alabakovski took part in a charity song called \"Otvori Oci\" (\"Open Your Eyes\") written by Darko Dimitrov, in which the Macedonian divas Elena Risteska, Kaliopi, as well as Aleksandra Pileva, Adrian Gaxha and Maja Grozdanovska-Pancheva participated. Shortly after that, MKTV revealed the list of participants for the national Macedonian Eurovision selection for 2006 and Alabakovski was a participant with the song \"More od Solzi\" (\"Sea of Tears\") written by Darko Dimitrov and lyrics by Elena Risteska. In March, Alabakovski and nineteen other artists took the stage in Skopje to compete for first place. He scored third place with 5282 points. Alabakovski released his debut album titled More od Solzi, which contained 10 song composed of his past hits and some new material. In June, he competed in the Budva festival in Montenegro with a Serbian song and in a duet with Aleksandra Pileva. They reached the final with \"Da Mogu Vreme Vratiti\" and finished in 12th place.\n\nAlabakovski competed at Skopje Fest 2007, the Macedonian Eurovision Song Selection. He performed the song \"Belo e Se\" which was written by Elena Risteska and composed by Robert Bilbilov. The song gained 101 points, placing Alabakovski in third position for a consecutive year. Alabakovski competed in the Macedonian Eurovision qualifier on 23 February 2008, with the song \"Zemjo Moja\".\n\nPersonal life\nAlabakovski moved to the US where he married his Macedonian-American girlfriend, Magdalena Jovčeska, in 2013. They have two sons together. The family returned to North Macedonia in 2021.\n\nControversy\nOn 7 June 2022, he was arrested by police officers in Bitola, regarding the case of the fire at the Bulgarian cultural center \"Ivan Mihaylov\" in the city. Searches were conducted in his home, during which items related to the crime were found and confiscated. Alabakovski fully admitted the crime and later criminal charges were filed against him. The incident was condemned by the presidents and prime ministers of both countries. The club itself sent a letter of protest to the embassies of the US and EU member states in North Macedonia. He was put in custody and had his passport revoked, which was replaced by house arrest, until he was released on 14 June. \n\nOn 4 July, during the 2022 North Macedonia protests, he symbolically burned in Skopje the Treaty of Good Neighbourhood with Bulgaria, the Prespa Agreement with Greece and the French proposal for the start of the negotiation process of North Macedonia and EU. According to him, these documents are fascist. This came on the third day of protests organized by the nationalist opposition against the EU's proposal to approve the country's negotiating framework.\n\nOn September 7, 2022, he was given a six-month suspended sentence. On 20 April 2023 in a podcast, commenting the incident he says: \"Seen from today's perspective, I am very joyful and happy with what I did...\".\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\nMore od Solzi\nVrati mi go Srceto\nDa ne te Ljubev (2009)\n\nSingles\nSpasi Me (Save Me)\nKade Pesno Moja (Where, My Song?)\nEh Da Mozam (If I Could)\nKazano E Se (It's All Said)\nMore od solzi (Sea of tears)\nI Posle Se (And After Everything)\nBelo e Se (Everything's White)\nVrati Mi Go Srceto ft.

        "Anna M. Longshore Potts (, Longshore; April 16, 1829 – October 24, 1912) was an American physician and medical lecturer of the long nineteenth century. She was one of eight members of the first graduating class of the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. She practiced in Philadelphia for a few years after her graduation, then for five years in Adrian, Michigan. Thereafter, she made a tour of the Pacific coast and elsewhere in the United States as well as New Zealand, Australia, and England on the prevention of sickness. She traveled around the world twice and gained a reputation as an author and lecturer. Her lifework was a crusade against ignorance and prejudice; as she said, a \"diffusion of physiological knowledge would not only tend to prevent disease, but would also be a potent factor in the preservation of morality\". Potts belonged to numerous clubs.\n\nEarly life and education\nAnna Mary Longshore was born in Attleboro (now Langhorne), in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, on April 16, 1829. Her parents were Abram and Rhoda Longshore. Anna's siblings included brothers Cary Longshore, Isaac S. Longshore, Thomas Ellwood Longshore, and Dr. Joseph S. Longshore,and at least one sister, Elizabeth Longshore Burgess.\n\nIn 1852, at the age of 22, Potts graduated from the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, as one of eight students in the college's first graduating class.. One of her classmates, Hannah Longshore, married Potts' brother Thomas and became the mother of Potts' niece Lucretia Longshore Blankenburg.\n\nCareer\nAfter earning a medical degree from the Woman's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1852, Potts opened a lucrative medical practice in Philadelphia. Her health became impaired, and in 1857, she returned to her hometown of Langhorne, where she married a merchant, Lambert Hibbs Potts (b. 1831). They had a son, Emerson.\n\nA few years later, Dr. Longshore, now Dr. Longshore-Potts, moved to Adrian, Michigan, where she quickly rose to a high position in her profession. She became imbued with the belief that a physician's most sacred duty is to prevent rather than cure disease, and to that end, she gave many private lectures to her patients. The ability of those talks led to her giving a course of public lectures, the meeting being called by the mayor, leading physicians and clergymen. That was in 1876. Her addresses were so favorably received that she concluded to devote all her time to them. She commenced first in small towns, with a boy as agent, who engaged churches and wrote with crayon in blank spaces the place and time of the meetings. Her success was continuous and, as she traveled out into larger towns, became almost phenomenal. The first city of any consequence which she visited as a lecturer was San Francisco, where she appeared in 1881. She then visited the principal coast towns, north as far as Seattle, Washington and south to San Diego, California. \n\nIn May, 1883, she sailed with her party, then consisting of seven, for New Zealand, where, from Auckland to Invercargill, the largest houses were packed to listen to Potts. In November, 1883, she stood before an audience of 4,500 people in the exhibition building, Sydney, New South Wales, where she was introduced by Charles A. Kahlothen, U.S. Consul. The proportions of her enterprise may be judged from the fact that her party had been increased to nine people, and it cost her  to rent the chairs necessary to seat that building for five lectures. She received a greeting there which was repeated in Melbourne, Brisbane, and the larger interior towns of the colonies. \n\nIn November, 1884, she sailed for London, England, where she delivered her first lecture in the large St James's Hall, on February 17, 1885, where Edwin Atkins Merritt, then U.S. Consul-General, presented her to an audience of 3,500 people. Lady Claude Hamilton placed her mansion in Portland Place at Potts' disposal, and between her lectures, which continued for five months, and her receptions in the Hamilton mansion, she stirred London. Every daily paper and all the leading weeklies accorded her praise. She gave one course of lectures for the benefit of the woman's hospital in Soho Square. Many leading charities received substantial aid from her. She spent nearly three years in the U.K., lecturing in all the chief provincial cities and repeating her lectures in London at frequent intervals. \n\nIn October, 1887, she returned to the United States, making her first appearance in Tremont Temple, Boston. She then appeared in Chickering Hall, in New York City, and from there went to California, lecturing only in the large cities. Just five years from the time she sailed for the Antipodes, she stood before an audience in the Baldwin Theater, San Francisco, that packed that building. Before her departure from the U.S., she purchased  of wild land near San Diego, and during her absence, she had it converted into a garden, in the center of which was erected a beautiful house of three stories, costing upwards of , an institution that became a public monument to her brother, Dr. Joseph Longshore, who was the most active in obtaining the charter for her alma mater.\n\nAfter her return to the U.S., in 1889, she established the Paradise Hotel and Sanitarium in National City, California. She also visited all the large cities in the country. In January, 1890, the close of her lectures in the Grand Opera House, Indianapolis, Indiana, was marked by an unusual scene. The large audience of women rose and greeted her with prolonged cheers, and a committee presented her with an elegant testimonial engrossed on parchment and signed by Caroline Scott Harrison, Eliza Hendricks, May Wright Sewall, Mary Harrison McKee, Governor Alvin Peterson Hovey and many members of the State Senate and House of Representatives, and when she returned there two months later, the common council placed the use of Tomlinson Hall at her disposal without charge.\n\nPotts published three books, Discourses to women on medical subjects (1887), Love, courtship and marriage (1891), and \nThe logic of a lifetime (1911). The last of these was a volume of essays self-published at Alameda, California. According to a review in Light (1911):— \"It consists of more than 60 brief papers in essay form ranging over many subjects, useful and educative, although at times, a trifle declamatory. Various passages in the book show that the author is in full sympathy with the great harmonising conception of a life beyond, and she writes with conviction of the soul's eventual entrance into another sphere.\"\n\nDeath\nAnna Mary Longshore Potts died in San Diego, California, October 24, 1912. At the time of her death, she was believed to have been the last surviving member of the first graduating class of the Women's Medical College of Philadelphia.\n\nSelected works\n Discourses to women on medical subjects, 1887\n Love, courtship and marriage, 1891\n The logic of a lifetime, 1911\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n1829 births\n1912 deaths\n19th-century American physicians\n20th-century American physicians\n19th-century American women physicians\n20th-century American women physicians\nWikipedia articles incorporating text from A Woman of the Century\nAmerican medical writers\nWomen medical writers\nPeople from Langhorne, Pennsylvania\nPhysicians from Pennsylvania\nWoman's Medical College of Pennsylvania alumni\nClubwomen\n20th-century American essayists\nAmerican women essayists\nAmerican lecturers",

        "The guinguette (), originating in the 17th Century, was a type of popular tavern in the suburbs of Paris and of other cities in France. The term comes from guinguet, a type of cheap green wine served there.\nA goguette was a similar kind of establishment.\n\nHistory\nDuring the 18th century, a consumer revolution led once isolated villages and hamlets outside Paris to be swept up in a booming material culture. Commodities, and particularly alcohol, consumed outside the customs barrier of the city were considerably cheaper, being exempt from state taxes. This encouraged the growth of an entertainment industry just beyond the tax man's reach and a network of drinking establishments was established. They were especially popular on Sundays and holidays, when Parisians would visit to enjoy themselves and to get drunk cheaply. Today, the term 'guinguette' is still used for a waterside refreshment stand, particularly open-air, all over France.\n\nThe development of railways in the 1880s and the establishment of the \"Gare de la Bastille\" (Bastille station) with many trains serving the eastern suburbs of Paris (such as Nogent sur Marne) contributed to the success of guinguettes.\n\nGeography\nThe majority are on the edges of the Seine and the Marne rivers, and some are in a district that stretches to the outskirts of Rouen. Some guinguettes were however far from the rivers, as the picturesque guinguettes of le Plessis-Robinson built among the chestnut trees. There were hundreds of guinguettes as far away as Nogent-sur-Seine, where the nature of the Seine valley changes most.\n\nDecline and rebirth of the tradition\nToday guinguettes are objects of nostalgia. The guinguettes were marvelous places to return to lighter times during the Années folles of the 1920s. They were obviously an eminent subject for painting during the first half of the 20th century.\n\nBut television and the ban on bathing in the rivers in the 1960s caused the decline of guinguettes. This ban was justified for reasons of hygiene (water quality deteriorated in the 1960s and 1970s) and safety (the risk due to barge traffic and drowning). In the 1960s, guinguettes became a subject of nostalgia. Many people forgot guinguettes, as the French scriptwriter Michel Audiard had one of his characters point out. Since the 1980s, there has been a small revival, particularly along the Marne river. In 2008, some guinguettes were open every weekend.\n\nAs of 2011 a gradual return to modern guinguettes had begun.\n\nSee also \n\nBal-musette\nCafé-concert\nEugène Imbert\nLapin Agile\n\nReferences\n\nMovies with guinguettes \n  (\"Nogent, Sunday Eldorado\") - Marcel Carné, 1929  \n La belle équipe (\"The Fine Crew\") - Julien Duvivier, 1936, with Jean Gabin singing the well-known waltz Quand on s'promène au bord de l'eau (\"Walking at the Water's Edge\")\n Casque d'or (\"Golden Helmet\") - Jacques Becker, 1952\n\nExternal links \n web site of a guinguette on the Marne river  \n website of the \"Culture Guinguette\" association  \n\nCulture of France\nDance venues",

        "Rae Anne \"Raeanne\" Rubenstein (September 15, 1945 – \tNovember 30, 2019) was an American portrait photographer. She was best known for her photographs from the late 1960s art rock scene and subsequently for her photographs of the country music scene.\n\nEarly life and education \nShe was born on September 15, 1945, on Staten Island, and her father, Isidore, owned the Tudor Furniture Company, and her mother, Sylvia (Grossman) Rubenstein, taught elementary school. She attended Curtis High School before moving to the Annenberg School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating in 1967.\n\nCareer \nRubenstein started her photography career by providing complimentary portraits for the celebrity interviews of her journalist friend Lita Eliscu. This resulted in her introduction to Andy Warhol, who she regularly photographed throughout the 1960s and who also introduced her to many celebrities at his Factory venue. Bonnie Garner arranged for her to have access to the Fillmore East, where she documented many rock acts including Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Jim Morrison, John Lennon, Yoko Ono, Lou Reed, Pink Floyd and Joe Cocker.\n\nA trip to Nashville in 1975 resulted in a love affair with the personalities of country music, producing a large body of work on celebrities like Lynn Anderson, Johnny Cash, Tammy Wynette, Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson. This content provided material for multiple books and exhibitions.\n\nShe enrolled in 2009 in Watkins Film School and subsequently produced, directed and photographed short movies. Rubenstein died on November 30, 2019, in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nBibliography \n\n Honkytonk heroes: A photo album of country music, published by Harper & Row (hardcover 154 pages, 1975, )\n Gone Country: Portraits of New Country Music's Stars, published by Schirmer Trade Books (hardcover 200 pages, 1997,  )\n\nReferences \n\nAmerican portrait photographers\n20th-century American photographers\n21st-century American photographers\nFashion photographers\nPhotographers from New York City\n1945 births\n2019 deaths\n20th-century American women photographers\n21st-century American women photographers",

        "The Third Pole, also known as the Hindu Kush-Karakoram-Himalayan system (HKKH), is a mountainous region west and south of the Tibetan Plateau. Part of High-Mountain Asia, it spreads over an area of more than  across nine countries, i.e. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan and Tajikistan. The area is nicknamed \"Third Pole\" because its mountain glaciers and snowfields store more frozen water than anywhere else in the world except for the Arctic and Antarctic polar caps. With the world's loftiest mountains, comprising all 14 peaks above , it is the source of 10 major rivers, and forms a global ecological buffer.\n\nThe Third Pole area possesses huge socioeconomic and cultural variance; being home to a range of ethnic communities conversing in more than 600 languages and many more dialects. It is rich with natural resources and consists of all or some of four global biodiversity hotspots. The mountain resources administer a wide range of ecosystem benefits and the base for the drinking water, food production and livelihoods to the 220 million inhabitants of the region, as well as indirectly to the 1.3 billion people — one sixth of the world's population — living in the downstream river basins. More than 3 billion people benefit from the food and energy produced in these river basins whose headwaters rely on meltwaters and precipitations that run off these mountains.\n\nThird Pole and climate change\nClimate change is now a key concern in the Third Pole. Mountain set-ups are especially sensitive to climate change and the Third Pole area is inhabited by a populace most susceptible to these global alterations. Modifications in the river systems have had a direct impact on the contentment of a multitude of people. The rate of warming in the Third Pole is considerably greater than the global average, and the rate is increased at an elevated altitude, indicating a greater susceptibility of the cryosphere environment to climate change. This trend is expected to continue. Climate change projections suggest that all areas of South Asia are likely to warm by at least 1 °C by the turn of the century, while in some areas the warming could be as much as 3.5 to 4 °C. The lives and livelihoods of those living in the Third Pole region are challenged by climate change, and the security and development of the region impacted by the Third Pole are in peril. This will have ramifications for the entire continent, and indeed the effects will be felt worldwide. However, there is insufficient awareness of this risk and its potential knock-on effects outside of the impacted region; a special effort is required to increase the attention given to the fragility of the mountain social-ecological set-up.\n\nEfforts for monitoring climate change and its impacts in the TP region\nWorld Meteorological Organization (WMO) has planned to set up a network of regional climate centers in this region and named this as TP-RCC Network. A \"Scoping Meeting on the Implementation of Third Pole Regional Climate Centres Network\" was held during 27 March to 28 March 2018 at WMO Headquarters Office in Geneva, Switzerland. In this meeting it was decided that China, India and Pakistan will be the leading nodes for this network. Another meeting, \"Implementation Planning Meeting of the Third Pole Regional Climate Centre Network\", was also conducted during 13 December to 14 December 2018 in Beijing, China.\n\nAn international scientific programme called the Third Pole Environment or TPE has set up 11 ground stations and tethered balloons since 2014, working with the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Beijing. This monitoring network is already larger than similar efforts in Antarctica and the Arctic, and almost doubles the number of such stations around the world.\n\nAnother proposed programme named \"Enhancing Climate Resilience in the Third Pole\" by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) seeks to strengthen the use of weather, water and climate services in the Third Pole region to adapt to climate variability and change and to apply well-informed risk management approaches and will be implemented under the umbrella of the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS). The proposed programme reflects the recommendations stemming from the “Regional Consultation on Climate Services for the Third Pole and other High Mountain Regions 2\" that was held on 9–11 March 2016 in Jaipur, India. The consultation brought together experts from the NMHSs and key decision-makers and practitioners from the five priority areas of the GFCS (agriculture and food security, energy, health, water and disaster risk reduction). The programme's objectives will be achieved by strengthening regional support networks and institutional capacities, developing tools and products that are needed for anticipating climate variability and change. The primary measurable benefits include approximately 260 million direct and 1.3 billion indirect beneficiaries from the region who will gain access to critical weather and climate information, which will result in reduced disaster risk, improved water resources management and improved agricultural productivity. The regional component is complemented by a continuum of synergistic national components in each of the countries within the Third Pole region. The activities that will be implemented at the national level will demonstrate the value of effective application/integration of the enhanced capacity at regional level that will result in improved agricultural production, reduced disaster risk and improved water management in least developed countries (LDCs) in the Third Pole (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Myanmar). The programme is aligned with the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) of LDCs in the Third Pole (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal and Myanmar) which place agriculture followed by disaster risk reduction and water as top priority sectors for adaptation actions. The Programme has three main objectives:\n Enhance climate information services to better anticipate the effects of climate change on the cryosphere for vulnerability and adaptation assessment and planning;\n Improve early warning for extreme weather/climate events (i.e. heatwaves, droughts, GLOFs, landslides, etc.) to reduce the impacts of disasters on human lives and livelihoods;\n Strengthen the provision and use of weather and climate services for agricultural risk management and water management.\n\nA comprehensive inventory of glaciers and glacial lakes in the Pakistani part of the Third Pole has been successfully completed.\n\nReferences\n\nPolar regions of the Earth",

Baytelman graduated from the Theater School of the University of Chile in 1971 and made her debut in La Remienda and Tres Tristes Tigres, both by Alejandro Sieveking. In 1972 and 1973, she participated in the productions Chiloé cielos cubiertos, by María Asunción Requena, and Las troyanas by Euripides. Although best known for her extensive theatrical career, Baytelman gained recognition for her role as a prostitute in the film Julio comienza en julio, directed by Silvio Caiozzi.\n\nOn television, she stood out in telenovelas such as La gran mentira (1982), El juego de la vida, and Las hederas (both in 1983), El milagro de vivir (1990), and Rompecorazón (1994). However, her most significant success came from her role as Carla in the popular TVN sitcom Los Venegas, where she remained for two decades. In 2019, Baytelman was seriously injured in a hit-and-run accident with a cyclist. After a lengthy rehabilitation, she returned to acting in 2020.\n\nFilmography\n\nFilms\n\nTelenovelas\n\nSeries and unitaries\n\nReferences \n\n1949 births\nLiving people\n\nChilean television actors\nChilean film actors\n20th-century Chilean actors\n21st-century Chilean actors",

        "Sancho IV Garcés (Basque: Antzo Gartzia, Gascon: Sans Gassia French: Sanche; died 950 or 955) was the duke of Gascony from 930 until his death. During his tenure, Gascony shrank considerably as his brothers inherited important regions and the de facto and perhaps de jure independent duchy slipped into historical near-oblivion. \n\nHe is mentioned in the cartulary of Auch, as a son of García Sánchez, and the Códice de Roda, which mentions him as the heir of Gascony. On his father's death, he inherited the duchy itself, which included the viscounties of Lomagen, Gavarret, Tursan, and Bruillois. His younger brothers, William and Arnold, inherited Fézensac (including Armagnac) and Astarac respectively with the comital title. Thus was Gascony divided and diminished. \n\nIn 932, Flodoard records that the brothers Ermengol of Rouergue and Raymond Pons of Toulouse, Princes of Gothia, brought a \"Lupus Aznar Vasco\" with them to do homage to Rudolph of France. Lewis considers this \"Vasco\" to be the duke of Gascony and calls him \"Sánchez.\" The duke meant, however, would be Sancho. \n\nSancho had two illegitimate sons, Sancho, who later succeeded him, and William, who likewise succeeded his childless brother. A third son was Gombald, a noted pluralist bishop, who held the various sees of Gascony as one until being reappointed to the long-vacant archdiocese of Bordeaux. A fourth son Udalrich or Odulric is attested in charters; probably all were bastards.\n\nNotes\n\nSources\nLewis, Archibald R. The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society, 718–1050.

        "was a Japanese woodblock printer, one of the major postwar artists of the sosaku hanga (\"creative print\") movement.\n\nEarly life\nSekino Jun'ichirō was born in 1914 in the Yasukata district of Aomori, Aomori Prefecture, in northern Japan. From a young age he immersed himself in the study of printmaking. In middle school he started a magazine Ryokuju-mu (\"Dream of Green Foliage\") devoted to poetry and print.\n\nSekino studied at Nishida Takeo's Japanese Etching Institute and enrolled at private school to learn oil painting and drawing.  From 1931 he studied intaglio printmaking and lithography under Kon Junzō who considered his pupil \"an artistic genius.\"\n\nIn 1935 Sekino submitted an etching of Aomori harbor to a government sponsored Teiten exhibition and won a first prize. Later the same year he was awarded a prize for print exhibited at the Nihon Hanga Kyokai (Japanese Print Association).  He joined the Nihon Hanga Kyokai in 1938, and the Kokugakai (National Picture Association) in 1940.\n\nCareer\nIn April 1939 Sekino moved to Tokyo where he was employed by publisher Shimo Taro and met Kōshirō Onchi. He was one of the founding members of Onchi's Ichimokukai (First Thursday Society), where he was considered Onchi's \"right-hand man.\" During the Second World War, Sekino procured lodging and theater facilities for entertainment troupes. Through this role he met famous kabuki actor Nakamura Kichiemon I whose woodblock portrait he produced in 1947. Alongside further depictions of artists such as Shikō Munakata and Onchi, it became one of his most renowned pieces, and established him as the country's pre-eminent woodblock portraitist. \n\nBesides portraits, Sekino produced still lifes, landscapes (both rural scenes and cityscapes), depictions of animals, and abstract works. He also worked in lithography and etching, and in 1953 founded the Japanese Etchers Society.\n\nIn 1958, at the invitation of the Japan Society, Sekino taught at America's Pratt Institute. In 1963 Gordon Gilkey of the Oregon State University hired him to teach a class. He also taught at the University of Washington and worked in New Mexico at the Tamarind Studio where he studied with Glen Alps, the inventor of collography. In 1969 he returned to Oregon State where, in 1975, his series depicting the Fifty-three Stations of the Tōkaidō was exhibited with Hiroshige's famous 1834 version.\n\nPrints\nSekino was influenced by German Renaissance artist Albrecht Dürer and stated that, \"one of the things I like most about him is his thoroughness, his corner-to-corner completeness.\"\n\nSekino created over 400 prints. His years of studying printmaking techniques enabled him to produce work of a consistent and extremely high quality, in excess of most of his contemporary sosaku hanga artists.  Onchi honoured him in allowing Sekino to reprint his Portrait of Hagiwara Sakutaro, and he assisted Maekawa Senpan in his Hot Spring Notes series.\n\nAs well as the Fifty-Three Stations, Sekino created series such as: Old Capital, Prints of the Narrow Road to the Deep North, Collection of Aomori Folk Toys and Collection of Famous Japan Folk Toys.  He contributed to Onchi's 1945 series Scenes of Last Tokyo (Tokyo kaiko zue).\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n \n Merritt, Helen.

        "State Route 186 (SR  186) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Tennessee. It runs from Trenton southward to Jackson, passing through the towns of Gibson and Three Way along the way. The southern portion serves as a western bypass for the city of Jackson, which is signed as U.S. Route 45 Bypass (US 45 Bypass).\n\nU.S. Route 45 Bypass\n\nU.S. Route 45 Bypass (US 45 Bypass), also known as Keith Short Bypass, is an approximately 10 mile expressway bypass for US 45 in Jackson, Tennessee. It has the unsigned designation of State Route 186 (SR 186) for its entire length.\n\nRoute description\n\nUS 45 Bypass begins at an intersection with US 45 (SR 5/Highland Avenue) and US 70 (SR 1/E Chester Street) in downtown. It goes north as a four-lane divided highway, concurrent with US 70/SR 1, to leave downtown and pass through industrial areas to have a signalized intersection with State Street. It then curves to the north and US 70/SR 1 immediately split off and go east along Airways Boulevard towards McKellar-Sipes Regional Airport. US 45 Bypass continues through suburban neighborhoods to pass through a business district before having an interchange with Hollywood Drive. It then has a signalized intersection with US 412 Bus (SR 20/North Parkway) before widening to a six-lane at-grade boulevard. It then passes through another business district before having a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-40/US 412 (Exits 80 A/B) and reducing to four lanes. Temporarily becoming a limited-access highway, US 45 Bypass immediately has an interchange with Vann Drive and Country Club Lane, where it widens back to six lanes. It passes Union University before having at-grade intersections with Union University Drive/Channing Way, Oil Well Road, Old Humboldt Road, and Ashport Road. US 45 Bypass then comes to an end at an interchange with US 45 (SR 5/N Highland Avenue) and Passmore Lane a short distance later, with unsigned SR 186 continuing north along US 45/SR 5.\n\nMajor intersections\n\nRoute description\n\nGibson County\n\nSR 186 begins as a 2-lane secondary highway in Gibson County in Trenton at an intersection with US 45W slightly southeast of downtown and is known as Gibson Highway. It goes southeast through farmland to have an intersection with SR 420 to enter the town of Gibson, where it passes through downtown and has an intersection with US 79/US 70A/SR 76. (It is known as Main Street in Gibson). From here, SR 186 continues south (as just Highway 186) through farmland to have a short concurrency with SR 187 and have an intersection with SR 152 before crossing into Madison County.\n\nMadison County\n\nSR 186 runs south through farmland to enter Three Way, and has an intersection and becomes concurrent with US 45E/SR 43, where it becomes a four-lane divided highway, as well as an unsigned primary highway. They go southwest and almost immediately come to an interchange with US 45W/SR 5, where SR 43 ends and US 45E and US 45W merge to become US 45, which SR 5 and SR 186 follow south. They continue south as a six-lane divided highway for about  before coming to an interchange with Highland Street, where US 45/SR 5 branch off and SR 186 follows US 45 Bypass. US 45 Bypass/ SR 186 (also known as the Keith Short Bypass) continue south around the western side of the city of Jackson through suburban areas as a 4 to 6 lane expressway, where it has interchanges with Vann Drive, I-40/US 412 (Exit 80 A/B), an at-grade intersection with US 412 Bus/SR 20, and an interchange with Hollywood Drive. US 45 Bypass/SR 186 then come to an intersection and become concurrent with US 70/SR 1, where it makes a sudden sharp turn to the east to enter downtown, where it becomes an at-grade surface route before US 45 Bypass and SR 186 both come to an end at an intersection with US 45/SR 5.\n\nThe portion of SR 186 from Three Way to Downtown Jackson is unsigned.\n\nFuture\nThe city of Jackson along with TDOT is planning on re-routing SR 186 (along with US 45 Bypass) away from downtown. Under the current plans, it would extend the bypass south across the South Fork of the Forked Deer River and connect it with US 45 in South Jackson. It would route through traffic away from the central business district and give another crossing for South Jackson commuters.\n\nMajor intersections\n\nSee also\n\nList of state routes in Tennessee\n\nReferences\n\nTennessee Department of Transportation (24 January 2003). \"State Highway and Interstate List 2003\".\nSouthern Extension of the US 45 Bypass Study :: Jackson, Tennessee\n\nExternal links\nTennessee Department of Transportation\n\n186\nTransportation in Gibson County, Tennessee\nTransportation in Madison County, Tennessee\nFreeways in Tennessee",

        "The Party of the Guatemalan Revolution (, PRG) was formed in June 1952 during the Guatemalan Revolution to unite the non-Communist parties which were supporting the administration of Jacobo Árbenz. These included the Popular Liberation Front, the National Renovation Party, the Revolutionary Action Party, and the Socialist Party. The Communist Guatemalan Party of Labour (PGT) was opposed to the formation of the PRG, fearing that it would undermine their influence in the government. The PAR and the PRN later withdrew. Although the PRG continued in existence until the overthrow of the President Árbenz, it had failed to achieve its original purpose of opposing Communist efforts to gain a predominant voice in the Árbenz government. It was disbanded after the coup d'état of 1954.\n\nBibliography \n Communism in Guatemala, 1944-1954. by Ronald M.

        "Cleistocactus buchtienii is a species of columnar cacti in the genus Cleistocactus.\n\nDescription\nCleistocactus buchtienii grows as a shrub with branched, rigid shoots at the base and reaches heights of growth of up to 1.5 meters (rarely up to 3 meters) with a diameter of up to 5 centimeters. There are about 16 to 19 (rarely up to 22) low ribs present, which are conspicuously notched. The needle-like, reddish-brown to straw-yellow spines are difficult to distinguish between central and radial spines. The 4 central spines are spread out and up to 3.5 centimeters long. The radial spines, which are 8 to 15 to 2 centimeters long, are slender and spread out.\n\nThe wine-red to bluish pink flowers are up to 6 centimeters (rarely up to 8 centimeters) long. The tips of the bracts are burgundy or greenish to dark green. The flowers are straight or very slightly curved, pointing slightly upwards, and are covered with short, dense hairs arising from the scale axils. The stamens do not protrude or hardly protrude, the style protrudes slightly to clearly from the flower. The spherical fruits tearing open at the base reach a diameter of 2 to 3 centimeters. They are yellowish green at the base and light purple above.\n\nDistribution\nCleistocactus buchtienii is found in the Bolivian departments of Cochabamba, Chuquisaca and Santa Cruz at altitudes of 2500 to 2750 meters (rarely up to 3100 meters).\n\nTaxonomy\nThe first description was in 1936 by Curt Backeberg. A nomenclature synonym is Echinopsis buchtienii (Backeb.) Anceschi & Magli (2013).\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nbuchtienii\nCacti of South America\nFlora of Bolivia\nFlora of the Andes",

        "California Speaks was a statewide deliberative forum on health care reform that took place on August 11, 2007 in eight counties in California: Humboldt, Sacramento, Alameda (Oakland), Fresno, San Luis Obispo, Los Angeles, Riverside and San Diego. Nearly 3,500 people representing all segments of the population were randomly recruited to participate in this day-long discussion of health care reform proposals that are before the California legislature.\n\nBackground\n\nGovernor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California proposed comprehensive health insurance reform for California on January 9, 2007 that would lead to nearly universal health insurance coverage in the state. The plan involved a complex set of requirements that employers provide health insurance or pay into a state insurance pool, that health care providers and insurers pay a new fee, and that all individuals be legally required to carry health insurance. The state would use the new fees to expand free or low-cost health insurance to those with low incomes, would allow higher income individuals to purchase “catastrophic” insurance, and would require insurance companies to sell insurance to any applicant (called guaranteed issue)  By mid-year, two different Democratic proposals that overlapped the Governor’s proposal had merged into Assembly Bill 8 (AB8) and were seen as the most likely health insurance expansion bill to be passed and signed by California’s governor in 2007. Another bill with substantial support in the legislature proposed a single payer system, SB840. It was similar to a bill that had passed the legislature in a previous session and been vetoed by the Governor.\n\nMuch of the organizational ideas and effort were provided by AmericaSpeaks, a group which promotes deliberation as a community method in a variety of communities, regions and topics.\n\nThe forum\n\nCalifornia Speaks was designed as a non-partisan discussion about the major health insurance reforms in the state. Using neutral, accessible materials, a cross section of  Californians learned about the different options and voted during the forum about what the state should do. The options focused on issues concerning AB8 and, to a lesser degree, SB840. The product of the discussions will be presented to the Governor and legislative leadership to inform state legislation that is currently being negotiated in Sacramento.\n\nThe actual format of the discussions was that participants were divided into groups of 10–12 people, with a facilitator to make sure everyone got a chance to be heard. A discussion guide was provided which explained the background of the issues.\n\nEach table reported its ideas using wireless computers and participants voted on the proposals, using a polling keypad. The entire group responded to the strongest themes generated from table discussions and voted on final recommendations to decision makers. Also, various local sessions across the state were in contact via interactive television simultaneously.\n\nResults from the discussion were compiled into a report at the end of the meeting, and were given to participants, decision-makers and the media as the meeting concluded.\n\nAs a participant in the San Diego group, I don't understand the exclusion of every group throughout the state preferring a single party payee system to any of the choices offered for discussion. Those running the forum said that this choice had already been rejected by the state and we would not even be allowed to discuss or consider this as an option. The forum almost ended at that point as this is what the citizenry wanted.  The groups from Oakland and Humboldt counties were prepared to walk out if some version of a single party system wasn't included in the discussion. Our table was politically diverse in its make up, yet upon a straw vote ten of our twelve preferred some form of Medicare coverage for all.  Upon threat of there not being any discussion at all, we were allowed to consider how such a program would differ from the choices on the table, but nothing beyond that would be accepted.  I was a little stunned to hear groups of polar political differences in other issues be unified in their support of a health care system similar to the rest of the world's. Without my notes I can't report accurately on the remainder of the meeting, only that the participants had been muzzled and nobody had a chance to even discuss their opinions.\n\nThe results\nParticipants identified four key values to guide health care reform at the start of the forum: Health care should be affordable by all, everyone should have access, greed (profit) should not be part of the system, and wellness/prevention should be a priority. There was general support for the AB8/Governor’s range of proposals, with a number of conditions. Employer mandates were supported but most participants also wanted to assure that part-time and other employees were covered. Individual mandates were supported as long as there was an adequate standard for quality of care and other guarantees.  Over 80% of this cross-section of Californians expressed a willingness to “share the responsibility” for paying for expanded health insurance.\n\nThe impact\n\nThe results and interpretation were presented to representatives of the California Legislature and Governor on August 23, 2007. The intent of the process is that the opinions of this large (3,500 person) group of average Californians from around the state, who spent a full day discussing the issues, would inform the California health care reform debate.\n\nSee also\n AmericaSpeaks\n Medicare for All Act\n Universal health care\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n http://www.californiaspeaks.org/\n https://archive.today/20130414143111/http://www.calhealthreform.org/\n https://web.archive.org/web/20071009130315/http://www.cahealthreformnow.org/\n California OneCareNow Campaign\n Health Care for All—California\n Video Archive of CaliforniaSpeaks (in chapters) https://web.archive.org/web/20070929103347/http://www.fc-tv.com/clients/americaspeaks/webcast/\n Video Highlights (8-min) https://web.archive.org/web/20070929103253/http://www.fc-tv.com/FCVideo/CaliforniaSpeaks/caSpeaks5minlowres.wmv\n\nGovernment of California\nCitizens' assemblies\nHealthcare reform in California",

        "The University of Kelaniya (UoK; , ) is a public university in Sri Lanka. Just outside the municipal limits of Colombo, in the city of Kelaniya, the university has two major institutions and seven faculties.\n\nHistory\n\nThe University of Kelaniya has its origin in the historic Vidyalankara Pirivena, founded in 1875 by Ratmalane Sri Dharmaloka Thera as a centre of learning for Buddhist monks.\n\nWith the establishment of modern universities in Sri Lanka in the 1940s and 1950s, the Vidyalankara Pirivena became the Vidyalankara University in 1959, later the Vidyalankara Campus of the University of Ceylon in 1972, and, ultimately, the University of Kelaniya in 1978.\n\nThe University of Kelaniya has pioneered a number of new developments in higher education. It was one of the first universities to begin teaching science in Sinhala and the first to restructure the traditional Arts Faculty into three faculties: Humanities, Social Sciences, and Commerce and Management.\n\nIt has several departments not generally found in the Sri Lankan University system and some Kelaniya innovations have been adopted subsequently by other universities. These include the Departments of Industrial Management and Microbiology in the Faculty of Science; Departments of Linguistics, Fine Arts, Modern Languages and Hindi in the Faculty of Humanities; and Mass Communication and Library and Information Sciences in the Faculty of Social Sciences.\n\nSymbols\n\nCoat of arms\nThe coat of arms of the University of Kelaniya is circular and consists of three concentric bands, the outermost of which contains the name of the university in Sinhala and English. The motto of the institution, \"Pannaya Parisujjhati\" (\"Self-purification is by insight\"), is a quotation from the Alavaka-sutta of the Samyutta Nikaya, given in Sinhala characters in the same band. The middle band containing a creeper design encloses the innermost, which shows a full-blown lotus, signifying purity. These two designs are reminiscent of those occurring in the well-known moonstones at Anuradhapura.\n\nFaculties\n\nFaculty of Science \nThe Faculty of Science started functioning in October 1967 with Charles Dahanayake as the dean of science. The intake of the first batch of students was 57. Formal approval for the faculty was given by the minister of education in 1968.\n\nThe science faculty was housed in the main building known as the \"Science Block\". Due to the continued increase in the student intake from year to year, a new lecture theatre complex and an auditorium were constructed in 1992, which enabled the intake of students to be increased to 450 in 2003. A new laboratory complex for the Chemistry Department and three buildings for the Departments for Industrial Management, Microbiology and Zoology have now been completed.\n\nThe science faculty was the first among the Sri Lankan universities to initiate the changeover from the traditional three subject (General) degree with end of year examinations to a more flexible course unit system, i.e., a modularized credit-based system in a two-semester academic year with the end of semester examinations. It offers a variety of course pathways designed to provide flexibility in the choice of subjects. Under this system students have the option of reading for a traditional three subject degree or for a degree consisting of two principal subjects and a selection of course units drawn from other subject areas. The BSc (Special) degree courses, begun in 1974, adopted the course unit system in 1986.\n\nCurrently, Prof. Sudath Kalingamudali is the dean of the faculty of Science.\n\nThe faculty consists of eight departments.\n Department of Botany\n Department of Chemistry\n Department of Industrial Management\n Department of Mathematics\n Department of Microbiology\n Department of Physics and Electronics\n Department of Statistics & Computer Science\n Department of Zoology & Environmental Management\n\nFaculty of Medicine \nThe Faculty of Medicine of the University of Kelaniya is on a  campus at Ragama. It is one of eight medical schools in Sri Lanka. The faculty began classes with the admission of 120 students in September 1991 after the government, in 1989, nationalised the North Colombo Medical College (NCMC), the first privately funded medical school in Sri Lanka established in 1980. The first batch of students, of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya completed their five-year course and graduated MBBS in September 1996. Prof. Carlo Fonseka was the first dean of the faculty. Subsequent deans were Prof. Janaka de Silva, Prof. Rajitha Wickremasinghe, Prof. Nilanthi de Silva,Prof. Prasantha S. Wijesinghe and Prof. Janaki de S. Hewavisenthi. The current dean is Prof. Madawa N. Chandratilake.\n\nThe faculty now has over 1,000 medical students. This number includes international students, mainly from other South Asian countries, who have been admitted on a fee-levying basis. The faculty also welcomes students for elective appointments. Students from medical schools in Europe, USA and Australia have spent their elective periods with the university. In addition to the MBBS course, it conducts a BSc programme in speech and hearing sciences.\n\nThere is a permanent academic staff of over 120 and in addition 40 temporary academic staff and over 60 visiting staff that includes consultants who are based in the affiliated teaching hospitals.\n\nFaculty of Social Science\nThe Faculty of Social Sciences, in student population, is the largest faculty in the University of Kelaniya.\n\nDepartment of Library and Information Science\n\nFaculty of Humanities \nThe faculty includes disciplines associated with Buddhist and Asian cultures, such as Pali and Buddhist Studies, Sinhala, Tamil, Sanskrit, Hindi, Japanese, Chinese and Korean ( One and only sri lankan University that has a 4 years of Korean Language Degree) while teaching courses in modern European languages such as English, French, German and Russian.\n\nFaculty of Commerce and Management \nThe faculty consists of four departments:\n Department of Commerce\n Department of Accountancy\n Department of Marketing Management\n Department of Human Resource Management\n Department of Finance\nThe Department of Commerce was the first to be established and contribute graduates to the industry. BCOM degree is unique to the Department of Commerce. Department provides special degree in Financial Management(BCOM (special) Degree in Financial management), Business technology(BCOM (special) Degree in Business Technology), Entrepreneurship(BCOM (special) Degree in Entrepreneurship) and Commerce(BCOM (special) Degree in Commerce).\n\nFaculty of Computing and Technology \nThe University of Kelaniya established its 7th Faculty - the Faculty of Computing and Technology (FCT) on 30 December 2015 and the Faculty commenced its operations on 18 January 2016.\n\nThe Faculty will offer Postgraduate Programmes in the areas of Computer Science, Software Engineering, Information Technology and Engineering Technology. The Master of Information Technology in Education programme is currently being developed for the Ministry of Education to train ICT teachers in the national education system.\n\nThe faculty will conduct research in diverse fields of significant impact. The research enterprise at the Faculty of Computing and Technology will expand from fundamental Computer Science research to the development of new technologies with applications to the industry and society as a whole. The Faculty is planning to propose the following Research and Development Centres:\nCentre for Nanotechnology\nCentre for eLearning\nLanguage Engineering Research Centre\nCentre for Geo-informatics\nCentre for Computational Mathematics\nCentre for Data Science\nCentre for Cyber Security and Digital Forensics\n\nFaculty of Graduate Studies \nTwenty-three postgraduate degree programmes and six postgraduate diploma programmes are coordinated by the Faculty of Graduates Studies.\n\nPostgraduate diplomas\n\nRegional Planning\n Information Technology\n Industrial and Business Management\nEnvironmental Management\nMathematics\nHuman Resource Management\n\nPostgraduate degrees\n M.A. in Sinhala\nM.A. in Linguistics\nM.A. in Drama and Theatre\nM.

In parallel to Vidyalankara Pirivena became Vidyalankara University in 1959, the library was started with a collection of books belonging to Vidyalankara Pirivena. Subsequently, it was shifted to the current premises in 1977. Later, as this old building was not sufficient enough to accommodate its growing collection and student population, the newly built four-storied building was added to the library system in 2013. Presently, the library owns a collection of over 245,000 books and monographs relevant to various study programmes and research activities in the university. Furthermore, the library has subscribed to EBSCO HOST, JSTOR, Emerald, Oxford University Press, Taylor and Francis databases with access facilities for more than 20,000 academic e-journals and more than 100,000 e-books.\n\nProfessional librarians have been appointed for each faculty to fulfil the informational requirements and information literacy training needs of the users.

        "\"Leagues Beneath\" is a single by the American stoner doom band Sleep. The song was released for free digitally on May 23, 2018 through Adult Swim's 2017 singles series, marking Sleep's second entry following 2014's \"The Clarity\". \"Leagues Beneath\" was released a month after the band's 2018 return album, The Sciences, which marked Sleep's first full-length studio release in twenty years. Later in 2018, \"Leagues Beneath\" was released on etched vinyl through Third Man Records.\n\nComposition\nMusically, \"Leagues Beneath\" is a long, slow epic that begins with B-tuned guitar and gradually builds by introducing new elements. Al Cisneros' vocals are not heard until nearly six minutes into the track. After the song's protracted crescendo, it concludes with a somber passage where layers strip away and give way to clean, psychedelic string sounds. Phil Witmer of Vice praised \"Leagues Beneath\", writing that it is \"possibly bigger than anything on The Sciences\", and Brock Thiessen of Exclaim! called it \"sprawling\" and \"a total scorcher\". Revolver wrote that the song is \"droning, transcendental, [and] punctuated with next-level riffing.\" At nearly seventeen minutes, \"Leagues Beneath\" is the group's longest track since 1999's \"Dopesmoker\" and, by some metrics, constitutes an EP.\n\nTrack listing\n\nPersonnel\nSleep\nAl Cisneros – vocals, bass\nMatt Pike – guitars\nJason Roeder – drums\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\"Leagues Beneath\" at Adult Swim\n\nAdult Swim singles\nSleep (band) songs\n2018 songs\nWilliams Street Records singles",

        "In neuroscience, the lateralized readiness potential (LRP) is an event-related brain potential, or increase in electrical activity at the surface of the brain, that is thought to reflect the preparation of motor activity on a certain side of the body; in other words, it is a spike in the electrical activity of the brain that happens when a person gets ready to move one arm, leg, or foot.  It is a special form of bereitschaftspotential (a general pre-motor potential).  LRPs are recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) and have numerous applications in cognitive neuroscience.\n\nHistory\nKornhuber and Deecke's discovery of the Bereitschaftspotential (German for readiness potential) led to research on the now extensively used LRP, which has often been investigated in the context of the mental chronometry paradigm. In the basic chronometric paradigm, the subject experiences a warning stimulus, followed by an interval (foreperiod), and then an imperative stimulus that the subject must respond to (see chronometric paradigm). During this foreperiod, the subject may be able to prepare a unimanual response, based on information from the warning stimulus.  Part of this preparation includes a slow negative wave bilaterally distributed over pre- and post-central sites, the readiness potential.  Vaughan, Costa, and Ritter (1968) noted that the readiness potential was larger contralateral to the side of the body where the muscle contraction occurred. The only RPs that do not seem to be lateralized are face and tongue movements which have symmetrical distribution over both hemispheres with the maximum of the potential located in the lower half of the central sulcus. That the lateralized aspect of the readiness potential in general might be used to measure the amount of motor preparation for a direct specific action, termed \"corrected motor asymmetry\", was highlighted by De Jong and Gratton et al.\n\nPresent-day methodology\nThe LRP is elicited whenever a subject initiates a voluntary movement with his/her hand (or feet).  Typically, a subject may be given a task requiring a button press (or squeeze) response.  The LRP is recorded from the ERP over part of the motor cortex associated with the body part used to initiate the movement.\n\nThe LRP is classically studied in response cuing paradigms (see cueing paradigm) and calculated by subtracting potentials recorded over the left and right side of the scalp in the motor cortex (Coles 1988). For example, if a subject were to move his or her left hand, the subsequent event related potential would be recorded over two scalp sites with the larger negativity over motor cortex on the right side of the scalp (C4) and the smaller potential over the left side of the scalp (C3). This voltage for the C3 is subtracted from C4 to yield a value that is then averaged over the course of all the subjects responses for left hand movement. The exact same procedure occurs for deriving right hand movement. The averaged potential is the LRP. The larger negativity (excluding face and tongue movements) is seen contralateral to the moving body part for all movements except foot movements which display a paradoxical ERP on the scalp (larger negativity is ipsilateral to moving body part).\n\nLRPs may be stimulus-locked, meaning they are measured with respect to the moment the eliciting stimulus appeared, or response-locked, meaning they are measured with respect to the moment the subject performed the actual motor activity (as measured by the execution of the movement or by recording muscle activity in the effector). These two different kinds of analyses may reveal different kinds of effects.\n\nIf something in the experiment affects the amount of time it takes before the subject is able to make a decision about their response (for example, darkening the screen so it takes the subject longer to perceive the stimulus in the first place), a stimulus-locked analysis can show that the LRP itself starts later in that condition, but takes the same amount of time to \"build up\" to the real motor response.  On the other hand, if the experiment does not change this sort of \"premotor\" processing but does affect the amount of time the motor process itself takes, a response-locked analysis can reveal that the LRP starts further ahead of the response and takes longer to build up.\n\nMain paradigms with examples of applications in cognitive psychology\nThe LRP is a non-invasive brain measure that describes when someone starts preparing a motor response with either their right or left hand (note the measure would work for feet too, but it is most often applied for hand movements).  That means it can be used to access whether the brain is simulating an action even when the action is never carried out and even if the participant is unaware of the ongoing simulation.  This makes the LRP a powerful tool for investigating various questions in cognitive psychology.\n\nThere are three general types of inferences that the LRP can generate, including (1) whether a response has been preferentially activated, (2) the degree to which a response has been preferentially activated, and (3) when a response is preferentially activated.  Experimental paradigms that interface nicely with these questions include cueing paradigms, the Go/No-Go paradigm and paradigms that induce conflict in the response system.  Generally, cueing paradigms can be used to study factors that influence response preparation, the Go/No-Go paradigm is useful for asking questions about the temporal order of information processing, and conflict paradigms help answer questions about the types of information that reach the response system from other brain systems.  Outside of these paradigms, studies have also used the LRP component to characterize the contribution of response processes in various cognitive processes and in characterizing individual differences in behavior. Below is a review of some examples from these general categories of LRP applications, from a range of cognitive disciplines.\n\nCueing paradigms for studying factors that influence response preparation\nIn a basic cuing paradigm, for an LRP to occur there must be a cue presented that predicts a meaningful stimulus is about to be presented, to which the subject will have to respond.  This creates a foreperiod when their response or some instructed behavior is contingent on some event they've just been warned will happen.  The cue that predicts a future stimulus is usually called the warning stimulus, or cue, and the future stimulus to respond to is usually called the imperative stimulus, or target. Importantly, for the LRP to occur the imperative stimulus must be a cue that indicates which hand the subject should prepare to respond with, so that a period of response preparation occurs.  For example, if a cue indicates a 50% chance of responding with the right or left hand, then no LRP is likely to occur.  The amplitude of the lateralization effect is thought to represent the amount of differential response preparation elicited by the warning stimulus.  The amplitude of the LRP also indicates how close one is to the response threshold—the point in the LRP just before response initiation occurs.\n\nCueing paradigms may even influence response preparation when the subject is unaware of the cue.  In a special type of cuing paradigm the cue can be presented for a very short period of time (e.g., 40 ms) and preceded and followed by other visual stimuli that effectively \"mask\" the cue's presence.  This type of paradigm, called \"masked priming\", has been used with the LRP to see whether a cue someone is unable to identify at all is still able to influence the response system.  For example, one study showed that a masked prime that gave conflicting response information compared to the target reliably slowed subjects’ response times, even though the subjects reported never seeing the masked prime.  They also showed that the conflicting masked prime induced an LRP such that the brain started preparing a response based on the semantic information in the masked prime.  This suggests that a cue with newly learned meaningful implications for the motor system (i.e., arbitrary response-mappings) need not be consciously processed in order for response preparations to begin.  Thus since the LRP can pick up signals for responses never actually initiated or perceived of, it can uncover information processing that happens without our awareness but that can still affect our overt behavior.\n\nGo/No-Go paradigms for studying temporal order of information processing\nIn a Go/No-Go paradigm participants are told to respond with their right or left hand according to a specific feature of a presented target.  For example, subjects may be instructed to respond with their right hand if the target letter is red and with their left hand if the target letter is yellow. For the No-Go part, subjects are told to only respond to the hand-referenced feature based on some other feature of the target.  For example, they may be instructed to not respond if the letter is a vowel.  Trials consistent with instructions to respond are \"Go\" trials, and trials consistent with instructions to not respond are \"No-Go\" trials.\n\nThis paradigm helps answer questions about the order of information extraction by through comparison of LRPs (or lack of) to stimulus features in the Go versus No-Go conditions.  Specifically, an LRP on No-Go trials would signify that whatever feature was driving hand selection was processed sometime before processing of the feature that indicated no response was necessary. To verify the order of information extraction it is important to flip the features that are mapped to hand selection and the No-Go instruction.  If no LRP occurs in either condition of response and No-Go feature mapping, this suggests the stimulus features may be processed in parallel or at approximately the same time.  Like the cueing paradigms, the LRP in the Go/No-Go paradigm can also occur at different time points and vary in magnitude, which gives additional information about the timing of information processing and the magnitude of differential order of processing.\n\nFor example, one study used the LRP component to characterize the temporal order with which grammatical and phonological information about a word is retrieved when preparing to speak. Like described above, the experiment used a Go/No-Go paradigm, such that grammatical and phonological features of a depicted word to be vocalized were mapped to either the \"Go\" response or the \"No-Go\" response instruction.  The grammatical feature was the grammatical gender of the depicted noun; the phonological feature was phoneme that the noun label started with. Using the characteristic nature of the LRP, they showed that a response was prepared for grammatical features even when the phonological features of the word meant no response was necessary.  Importantly, no LRP was evident on No-Go trials when grammatical gender determined whether a response was necessary and phonology determined response hand, suggesting that grammatical information is indeed retrieved before phonological information. Similarly, another study used the LRP in a Go/No-Go paradigm to show that conceptual information about nouns (e.g., is the depicted item heavier or lighter than 500g?) is retrieved approximately 80 ms before grammatical information. These and other studies have been seen as support for a serial model of speech production in which conceptual information about a word is retrieved first, followed by grammatical information and then by phonological information. However, more recent research using the Go/No-Go paradigm has challenged this model, showing that the relative order with which lexical features are retrieved may be modulated by attentional biases, and that retrieval difficulty can selectively delay the retrieval of semantic information without impacting the timing of phonological retrieval. Together, these studies show how the LRP has helped to map out the temporal dynamics of information processing during speech production.\n\nOther studies have used the LRP in the Go/No-Go paradigm to study the temporal nature of information recalled about a person upon seeing their face.  Think about when you see someone you know in the hallway, and immediately your brain starts to conjure up facts related to the person like their name or memories like their hobbies, their job, or what their personality is like. Studies have typically shown putting a name to a face is harder than remembering biographical memories about someone.  Using the LRP, studies have tried to do precise mapping of different factors that affect the order of access to different types of information about someone, just by seeing their face.\n\nConflict paradigms for studying transmission of partial information\nAs described above, experiments have used the LRP to generate support for a continuous model of stimulus evaluation and response selection.  This model predicts that partial information is continuously available from the environment and information can accumulate to an eventual response or near response that is never actually committed.  This is in contrast to a discrete model that predicts full stimulus evaluation must be complete before response initiation can start.  Thus results using the LRP suggest that partial information is accumulated in the sensory systems and is sent to the motor system before and during response preparation (Coles et al., 1988).\n\nOne classic cognitive \"conflict\" paradigm that illustrates these findings is the Eriksen flanker task.  In this experiment participants must respond to a central target that is surrounded by distractors that either represent a response consistent with the target or a response inconsistent with the target (rather is consistent with the contralateral hand response).  If partial information transmission occurs, then on trials where the target is surrounded by response-inconsistent distractors, there should be an LRP indicating response preparation to the incorrect hand even when the eventual response was correct, and there should be no LRP to the same target when response-consistent distractors surrounded it and the correct response was given.  This pattern of results is traditionally shown.  Importantly, the effect holds regardless of the response mappings (across hands).\n\nThe flankers task requires blocking out irrelevant distractors from the environment, but what if the relevant and irrelevant features are embedded in one target stimulus?  This is often the case in the classic Stroop  task, such as when one must inhibit their natural response to read a word by responding to only the ink color that the word is printed in.  This requires focusing on the task-relevant features of a given stimulus while ignoring task-irrelevant features of the same stimulus.  Is information about both features processed simultaneously?  The LRP has been used to investigate transmission of partial information in this context. A nice example is in a paper co-authored by one of the first to discover the LRP, Dr. Gabriele Gratton.  In this study, the subject performs a spatial stroop task, where they are cued to respond to an upcoming word that is either the word \"ABOVE\" or the word \"BELOW\" presented physically either above or below a central fixation cross.  Subjects were cued (in random order) to respond to either the physical position of the word or to the conceptual meaning of the word.  Responses are typically slower and less accurate when word position and meaning are inconsistent.  For all conditions, the left and right hand button responses corresponded to the two response options.  The research question was whether during the spatial stroop task conflict on position-inconsistent (or, incongruent) trials is represented in the motor response stage as can be indexed by the LRP.  If an LRP was evident for incongruent trials, this suggests information about the irrelevant stimulus feature was processed at the response stage even on correct trials and this generated response conflict, again supporting a model of continuous information processing.  Indeed, the results supported this hypothesis. The study also collected event-related optical signal (EROS) data, which has a spatial resolution for imaging cortical activity in-vivo that is somewhat more coarse than functional magnetic resonance imaging, but has a temporal precision similar to event-related potentials (ERPs).  Using EROS they showed that at least one source of the LRP was the motor cortex ipsilateral to the response hand, supporting response conflict in the primary motor cortex as one source of conflict in the stroop task.\n\nOther uses\n\nAssessing the contribution of response-system effects in cognitive processes \n\nThe study by DeSoto et al., 2001 is a nice example of not only demonstrating support for a continuous model of information processing, but also of using the LRP to characterize the contribution of response-based conflict in a cognitive process.  This is also a type of application the LRP is useful for in cognitive psychology.\n\nClinical applications with the LRP\nThe LRP can also be used to characterize individual differences in aspects of information processing as described above.  One example of this has been the use of the LRP to study cognitive aging.\n\nFor instance, the LRP has been used to specify whether age-associated slowed processing originates in motor or higher-level cognitive processes, or both.  Yordanova et al., 2004 showed by using LRPs that stimulus processing and response selection were not affected by age. Rather there was slowing in response execution for older adults when there was increased response complexity (four response mappings) compared to simple stimulus-response mapping (one response mapping).  In a follow-up study by the same group Kolev et al., 2006 used the LRP again to show that the effects from their 2004 study generalized to the auditory domain, and to extend further support that the effects of aging on slowed response time in a four choice reaction time task is in the response generation and execution stage and not in stimulus processing and selection.\n\nGeneral summary of functional sensitivity\nBased on the classic studies outlining the LRP and some more recent applications of studying cognitive psychology with the LRP, what is the LRP functionally sensitive to?  What modulates its amplitude and latency, and what is that inferred to mean?\n\nGenerally, the amplitude of the lateralization effect is thought to represent the amount of differential response preparation elicited by the cue or warning stimulus.  For example, in cuing paradigms where the subject is given valid cues to the hand that should be used for the upcoming response, accuracy and reaction time are faster, and preparation of the correct hand, as measured by the LRP, can be seen in response to the cue.  Indeed, the presence of an LRP following a neutral cue (one that provides no information about hand) can be used to determine whether or not subjects are guessing.\n\nThe amplitude of the LRP also indicates how close one is to the response threshold—the point in the LRP that predicts response initiation.  In an experiment by Gratton, Coles, Sirevaag, Erikson, and Donchin in 1988, the time of response initiation, defined as the latency of onset of EMG activity, was examined in relation to the LRP.  It was found that the timing of response initiation was consistently associated with a particular LRP voltage, which can then be thought of as the response threshold.  When subjects are instructed to then inhibit an overt response, there is a decrease in the magnitude as well as a delay in the latency of the LRP for successful inhibitions. However, on partial inhibitions, the LRP still reaches the response threshold, even when the overt response is successfully inhibited, showing that the \"point of no return\" occurs after the LRP.\n\nBased on the work of Osman and colleagues we also know that in the Go/No-Go paradigm, feature discriminability (e.g., discriminate between V and 5, easy) or between l and 1 (lowercase l and the number 1, difficult) affects onset of the LRP difference between the \"Go\" and \"No-Go\" (response execution), but not LRP onset (response preparation).  In contrast, they've shown that stimulus-response compatibility affects LRP onset (response preparation) but does not affect the onset of the difference waves (response execution).  More generally, the distinction between response preparation and execution can refer to the time before and after the onset of the LRP such that the time between seeing the stimulus and the onset of the stimulus-locked LRP reflects response preparation processes and the time between onset of the stimulus-locked LRP and the behavioral response reflects response execution processes.  Overall, studies have shown that stimulus quality and stimulus compatibility affect response preparation processes, whereas factors related to response complexity tend to delay response execution processes.\n\nLater studies on event preparation examining the foreperiod of the contingent negative variation (CNV), which orients the subject to respond to warned stimuli, and the foreperiod of the LRP were used to study the exact mechanism of event preparation. In their paper on inferences from CNV and LRP they cited experiments done by Ulrich, Moore, & Osman (1993) in which three hypotheses could be derived. The abstract motor preparation hypothesis states that only the response hand that has been selected is prepared but nothing else. The muscle-unspecific preparation hypothesis suggests that muscles are cued at the same time when the limb side is not specified. The muscle-specific preparation hypothesis states that the muscle and limb are prepared when direction and limb side are specified. The muscle-specific preparation hypothesis gained the most support with follow up studies (Ulrich, Leuthold, & Sommer, 1998). Leuthold et al. suggest that the motor processes be divided up into early (motor-unspecific preparation hypothesis) and late (motor-specific hypothesis). Studies done by Sangals, Sommer, and Leuthold (2002) and Leuthold et al. (1996) conclude that LRP is largely affected by precuing effects. They demonstrate that the more the subject knows about the direction and which hand to move, for example, the larger the foreperiod of the LRP even in conditions that stress time and pressure.\n\nSee also\n\n Bereitschaftspotential\n C1 and P1\n Difference due to memory\n Early left anterior negativity\n Error-related negativity\n Late positive component\n Mismatch negativity\n N100\n N200\n N2pc\n N170\n Neuroscience of free will\n N400\n P200\n P300 (neuroscience)\n P3a\n P3b\n P600\n Somatosensory evoked potential\n Visual N1\n\nReferences\n\nElectroencephalography\nEvoked potentials",

She also competed against many of women's boxing top fighters.\n\nRiccio-Major was born in Pittsfield, Massachusetts in 1963. She began her career in professional boxing at the age of twenty-six, when she and Andrea Buchanan drew (tied) after five rounds on November 1, 1989, at Bristol, Tennessee. Riccio Major obtained her first victory, a five-round decision win over Stacey Prestage, on her second bout, held on November 17, 1990, in Fort Myers, Florida.\n\nFor her third bout, held on February 25, 1991, also at Bristol, she met young rising star Christy Martin, who dealt Riccio her first loss, beating her by a five-round decision.\n\nRiccio then took five years away from boxing, deciding to return during the dawn of the often called \"golden era of women's boxing\", when she took on Sue Chase on June 3, 1996, at Warrensville Heights, Ohio. The then thirty-three-year-old Riccio won by a five-round decision. On July 27, she lost to Theresa Arnold by an eight-round decision at Rochester, Washington.\n\nOn January 17, 1997, Riccio-Major earned her first, and only, professional boxing knockout win, when she defeated Patricia Simms in the first round, at Waukegan, Illinois.\n\nAfter that victory, she was offered her first shot at a world championship, when she met Cheryl Robertson, on February 3, for the WIBF's world bantamweight title. Riccio-Major lost by a ten-round decision, in New Orleans.\n\nImmediately after that title shot, Riccio-Major was offered another world title try, when she fought with the IFBA world Flyweight champion. Yvonne Trevino, in Biloxi. Once again, she lost by a ten-round decision.\n\nAfter that defeat, she scored three wins in a row, two against Karina Hernandez Gastelum. She suffered, however, a three fight losing streak after those three wins, being defeated by \"Downtown Leona Brown\" on points, by Trevino in a rematch which saw both women go down, by Tko in five rounds, when referee, the late Mitch Halpern stepped in for no apparent reason. a ref not wanted by the major team [ex Husband/Trainer, William Major] initially for his anti women boxing views. Trevino and her manager Jackie Kallen promised a rematch which never materialized and to Kathy Williams in her only fight abroad, on points. The fight with Williams was held in Canada.\n\nOn July 28, 2000, she got her last career win, beating Larissa Smith in Boston by a six-round decision. After losing to Jamillia Lawrence by knockout in two rounds on August 25 of that year in Saratoga Springs, New York, she retired from boxing in 2001.\n\nRiccio-Major had 7 wins, 8 losses some controversial and one draw in professional boxing, with one win by knockout.\n\nProfessional boxing record\n\nReferences\n\n1963 births\nLiving people\nAmerican women boxers\nSportspeople from Pittsfield, Massachusetts\nSuper-bantamweight boxers\n21st-century American women",

        "Thomcord is a seedless table grape variety and a hybrid of the popular Thompson Seedless or Sultanina grape (a Vitis vinifera variety) and Concord grape (a Vitis labrusca variety).  Thomcord was developed in 1983 by Californian grape breeders working for the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), as part of a test to better understand a new seedless grape breeding procedure.\n\nIts aromatic, \"labrusca\" flavor is similar to that of Concord, but mellowed by the mild, sweet taste from Thompson Seedless.  Thomcord grows well in hot, dry climates, ripens between late July and mid-August, and tolerates powdery mildew.  It is a productive variety, yielding an average of  of grapes per vine, but has produced as much as  per vine in grower trials.  The berries weigh between  and have a medium-thick, blue-black skin that adheres to the fruit, unlike Concord, which has a thick skin that can slip off the pulp easily.  The aborted seeds in the fruit body are relatively small, but larger than those in Thompson Seedless.\n\nThe plant is not restricted for propagation and distribution.  Virus-free propagation material is available from the Foundation Plant Services (FPS) at the University of California, Davis, and its genetic material is archived at the National Plant Germplasm System.  After 17 years of testing, it was declared ready for use in 2003.  It is currently available in supermarkets.\n\nDescription\nThomcord grape is a hybrid of Thompson Seedless grape (Vitis vinifera, or Sultanina), which is popular in American (?) supermarkets during the summer, and seeded Concord grape (Vitis labrusca), commonly used to make grape juice and jelly. It is a plump, juicy, seedless table grape and is slightly firmer than Concord. Thomcord has a blue-black skin with medium thickness and a whitish bloom. Unlike Concord, whose tough skin separates easily from the fruit, Thomcord has a more edible skin that clings to the flesh, much like Thompson Seedless. It has an aromatic flavor, similar to the Concord in taste (\"labrusca\"), though lighter due to the sweet, mild taste from Thompson Seedless.\n\nThomcord is suitable for hot, dry growing conditions, more so than Concord and other Concord seedless types.  Its adaptability to hot dry climates was derived from Thompson Seedless.  It grows well in California's vineyards, particularly the San Joaquin Valley, just like Thompson Seedless.  The plant is tolerant of (but not resistant to) powdery mildew, and is less susceptible to the fungus than Ruby Seedless, but more susceptible than Mars, Venus, Niabell, and Cayuga White varieties.  The fungus can affect its leaves, stems, rachis (stem of the grape cluster), and berries.  The grape ripens in the summer (mid-season), between late July and mid-August.\n\nProduction details\nThomcord is a productive variety, with a yield comparable to Thompson Seedless.  When two cordons (arms) of the vines are trained horizontally on wires (\"bilateral-trained\") and are pruned to remove most of the previous year's growth (\"spur-pruned\") during the winter, it can produce up to  per vine, or an average of .  In 2002, cane-pruned vines of Thomcord were significantly more productive than Sovereign Coronation and were comparable to the Venus variety, averaging  per vine.  Unlike Thompson Seedless, which has its cluster size thinned as a normal production practice, Thomcord's is not thinned because of its smaller cluster size.  The grape clusters range in weight between  and average , have medium to slightly loose tightness (or are \"well-filled\", meaning the individual pedicels are not easily visible), and have a conical shape with a small wing.\n\nCompared with Thompson Seedless, the berry weight and diameter of Thomcord are larger, but cluster tightness is similar.  The berry length ranged between  and the diameter ranged from  in tests between 2001 and 2002.  The berries weigh between , averaging  in 2002, which is on par with Venus, but heavier than Sovereign Coronation, and even more so than Thompson Seedless.  The fruit's size has not been shown to increase appreciably by girdling the vines or by applying gibberellic acid when the berries set.\n\nThe aborted seeds of Thomcord are small, but in some years they can become sclerified (a thickening and lignification of the walls of plant cells and the subsequent dying off of the protoplasts), making them more noticeable inside the medium-soft flesh.  There are usually two aborted seeds per berry, which averaged between 14 and 22.3 mg in 2001 and 2002.  This varied in comparison to Venus depending on the year and location, was comparable to the Sovereign Coronation, and was significantly smaller than the Sovereign Rose and Saturn varieties.  However, as with the other cultivars, it was consistently larger than Thompson Seedless, which had the smallest aborted seeds.\n\nVegetative description\n\nThe mature leaves on the vine have three lobes with open upper lateral sinuses (spaces between the lobes) of medium depth.  The main vein is slightly longer than the petiole (stalk attaching the leaf blade to the stem), and the petiole sinus opens widely.  Between the veins on the underside of both the mature and young leaf there are dense hairs that lie flat against the surface.  The teeth on the edge of the leaf blade are convex on both sides, medium in size, and short relative to their width.  Young leaf blades are dark copper red on the upper surface.\n\nThe shoots have at least three consecutive tendrils. Young shoots are fully open and have very dense hairs of medium anthocyanin coloration that lie flat against the tip.  The internode of the young shoot is green with red stripes on the front (dorsal) side and solid green on the back (ventral) side.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1983, research horticulturist David W. Ramming and technician Ronald L. Tarailo—Californian grape breeders working for the ARS, the chief scientific research agency of the USDA—crossed Thompson Seedless and Concord in order to answer a technical question about a newly developed procedure for breeding novel, superior seedless grapes.  The researchers wanted to demonstrate that plants created from embryo culture were derived from fertilized eggs (zygotic) instead of the maternal tissue (somatic).  From 1231 emasculations (removal of male flower parts to control pollination) of Thompson Seedless, the researchers produced 130 ovules using embryo rescue procedures.  From these, 40 embryos developed and three seedlings were planted.  The original seedling of Thomcord was planted in 1984 in plots in cooperation with California State University, Fresno.  It was later selected in 1986 by Ramming and Tarailo and tested in the San Joaquin Valley under the name A29-67, and was introduced as \"Thomcord.\"\n\nThe new hybrid was tested and scrutinized for 17 years before it was declared ready for growers and gardeners and was released on 11 September 2003.  Around 2008, trials outside of California were just beginning.  Thomcord quickly became a hit at farmers' markets while it was being tested, and it has appeared in the fresh-fruit section at supermarkets. This continued the long-standing success of the ARS' grape-breeding research in California, which has developed some of the most popular seedless grapes on the market as well as red, white, and black grapes varieties for hobbyists and professional growers since 1923.\n\nAlthough it has been called a \"sentimental favorite\" at farmers' markets, it is not expected to become a major commercial variety because its flavor is not as neutral as more popular grapes, such as Thompson Seedless, Crimson Seedless, or Flame Seedless.  However, Ramming predicted that it would become a specialty item, much like the Muscat varieties, due to its distinctive, Concord-like flavor.  Because of its strong reception at farmers' markets, it could compete with Concord and Niabell varieties in eastern markets, according to Ramming.\n\nAvailability\n\nThe Foundation Plant Services (FPS) at the University of California, Davis indexed Thomcord and found it to be free of known viruses.  The FPS offers certified virus-free propagation material.  The FPS also deposited genetic material in the National Plant Germplasm System, which offers material for research, including development and commercialization of new cultivars.  The ARS does not offer Thomcord plants for distribution.\n\nThomcord is a public variety and is not restricted in its propagation and distribution.\n\nSee also\n List of grape varieties\n\nReferences\n\nTable grape varieties\nHybrid grape varieties",

        "Zadock Pratt Jr. (October 30, 1790 –  April 5, 1871) was a tanner, banker, soldier, and member of the United States House of Representatives. Pratt served in the New York militia from 1819–1826, and was Colonel of the 116th regiment from 1822 until his resignation from the militia on September 4, 1826.\n\nIn the Catskill Mountains, Pratt built the largest tannery in the world at its time, and built the town of Prattsville to accommodate the labor force necessary for the tannery, raising the town's population from around 500 to over 2000. Pratt was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1836 and 1842. During his second term, in 1845 he first proposed the transcontinental railroad. In 1848, Pratt tried but failed to receive the Democratic/Hunker nomination for the 1848 New York state gubernatorial election. He was a delegate to the 1852 Democratic National Convention.\n\nIn 1843, Pratt established the Prattsville Bank with, which printed its own bills that were kept on par with the US dollar, but he closed the bank nine years later in 1852. Pratt financed multiple smaller tanneries in the Catskills, and also one in Pennsylvania as a joint venture with Jay Gould. In 1860 he retired from active business pursuits, and died in 1871, having survived four wives and his son.\n\nEarly life and family\nZadock Pratt was born on October 30, 1790, in Stephentown, New York, to Hannah Pratt (née Pickett) and Zadock Pratt Sr. He was the 5th of 7 children. In 1797, Pratt moved with his father's family to Middleburgh, New York. In 1802, at age 12, Pratt moved with his parents to Windham, New York (which soon became Lexington, and is current day Jewett). As a child, he received limited schooling at the public school, and instead worked on his father's farm and tannery. In his father's yard there were \"two limes\" and eight vats, and the bark was ground with a circular millstone by horse power.\n\nIn 1810, at age 20, Pratt became an apprentice to Luther Hayes, a sadler in Durham. Following his apprenticeship, he became a traveling saddler for a year, during which he saved $100. In 1812, he returned to Lexington where he continued his work as a saddler, working fourteen-hour days. In 1814, Pratt built a general store in Prattsville where he would barter with residents for goods, and would make periodic trips to New York City to trade the goods.\n\nPratt volunteered for the War of 1812 in 1814.  He was a Steward of a company stationed at Brooklyn Heights. He was awarded $11 for his claim of arms and clothing which were destroyed during the war. In 1857, he would receive a warrant of  of land for his service. In 1815, after war ended, he returned to Lexington, sold his store. On May 7, 1817, he entered the tanning business with  his older brother (Ezra) and his younger brother (Bennett).\n\nOn October 18, 1818, Pratt married Beda Dickerman of Hamden, Connecticut, who died of tuberculosis six months later on  April 19, 1819. Pratt and his brother Ezra then bought out Bennett's share of the tanning business for $2200.\n\nDuring the winter of 1819–20, Pratt and three of his neighbors went on a trading expedition to Canada to sell their leather and other goods. They were successful, and traded their leather for gold and furs from Canadian settlers, and from Native Americans at Rice Lake. On his return, he stopped at the bank in Catskill, New York, where he learned that his tannery had burned down in his absence The building was uninsured, and was a loss of $1000; the cause was never determined. However, he resolved to rebuild it. Friends of the Pratt family donated money and it was quickly rebuilt.\n\nIn 1821, Pratt was appointed a magistrate of Lexington. In 1823, Pratt married Esther Dickerman, sister of his first wife. Esther died less than a year later on April 22, 1824, also of tuberculosis.\n\nPratt's tannery\nPratt had been planning a tanning business much larger than what he was currently engaged in, and Esther's death put him into action. He dissolved his partnership with his brother, and, with $14000 in capital, began seeking a location for his new tannery. He spent the summer of 1824 exploring the surrounding counties with his dog for the best place for his planned operations. He decided on a region in the very western part of Windham, in what is current day Prattsville, for its large forests of hemlock, which was necessary for tanning at the time, as well as its proximity to the Schoharie Creek. The Prattsville Commercial Building, built about 1824, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996.\n\nOn October 24, he moved all of his belongings to the site and purchased the large meadow for $1300. The following day he broke ground on the tannery, and with the help of laborers, dammed the creek in the following weeks.\n\nThe tannery was 550' long, and 43' wide. There were 350 vats, 6 heaters, 12 leaches, two bark mills driven by a great wheel, and three hide mills.\n\nTannery foreman Osmer B. Wheeler later went on to open his own tannery, in Forestburgh, New York, and became a member of the New York State Senate.\n\nMilitary and remarriages\n\nOn April 25, 1820, Pratt was chosen as Captain of the Fifth regiment of New York State Artillery, which consisted of 130 men. Acquired a cannon that had been used at the Battle of Plattsburgh for the regiment.\nOn July 12, 1822, he became a Colonel for New York's 116th Infantry. In 1825, he commanded the escort of Lafayette into Catskill.\n\nOn October 12, 1827, Pratt married his third wife, Abigail P. Watson, of Rensselaer. Their son was State Senator George W. Pratt (1830–1862).\n\nOn November 20, 1832, he applied to the State Legislature to divide Windham, and on March 8, 1833, Prattsville was divided off from Windham. At the time it had a population of around 1500.\n\nOn January 26, 1834, Pratt's second daughter, Abigail, was born. Pratt's wife died 10 days later on February 5, aged 26. On March 16, 1835, Pratt married his fourth wife, Mary E. Watson, sister of his third wife. Mary Pratt died in Providence, New York on July 17, 1868.\n\nIn 1836, he was elected to New York's 8th District, and in the same election, was voted to be and elector for New York.\n\nIn 1839, Westkill Lexington tannery burned down. He lost $10,000 but was only insured for $7,000.\n\nPratt offered to endow  Prattsville Academy with $5,000 if the sum were matched by a Christian church.\n\nIn 1842, he was elected to New York's 11th District. That same year, he established the  Prattsville Advocate newspaper. J. L. Hackstaff was the editor. In the same year, the Prattsville Academy was built. The land was donated by Pratt, and he provided half of the building costs.\n\nIn 1848, he received and honorary Master of the Arts degree from Union College. In 1852, he was elected as a delegate to the 1852 Democratic Convention.\n\nPrattsville and his Tannery\n\nFirst term as Congressman\nIn 1836, Pratt earned the Democratic nomination for New York's 8th congressional district. He won general election by just short of 3,000 votes. On September 10, 1837 Pratt was appointed to the Committee of the Militia, and on December 11, was appointed to the committee on public buildings.\n\nOn March 19, 1838, Pratt introduced a bill to drastically lower postage rates, and argued that high postage costs disproportionately affected the poor, and that it was effectively a tax on intelligence, as it hindered the free passage of information. The bill was passed. He felt so strongly about the price of postage that on his grave he had inscribed \"WHILE MEMBER OF CONGRESS; MOVED THE REDUCTION OF POSTAGE; A.D. 1838\".\n\nOn February 25, 1839, Pratt suggested that public buildings no longer be built out of sandstone, but instead granite of marble, because they absorb very little water compared to sandstone, and therefore required less maintenance He also noted that marble was cheaper than granite, when including building costs.\n\nOn July 4, 1838, he announced that he declined re-election, although his constituents strongly wanted him to serve another term.\n\nMarch 18, 1839, Dry Dock in Brooklyn vs. Philadelphia.\n\nMint in New York vs. Philadelphia.\n\nDuring his first term, Pratt never missed a session.\n\nSecond term as Congressman\n\nPratt did not intend to run for Congress again after declining to run for re-election following his first term as Congressman. However, in 1842 he accepted the nomination.\n\nLegacy as a Congressman\n\nAs a congressman, Pratt pushed for legislation.\nReduce the cost of postage from $.25 to $.05 in 1838.\nCreate the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.\nConstruct public buildings in Washington, DC, of marble or granite, not sandstone.\nConstruct the Dry Dock in Brooklyn.\nInitiate first survey for the Transcontinental Railroad 1844.\nWhile in Congress he began a movement to complete the Washington Monument, and he also started a practice of hanging the Presidential Portraits in the Rotunda.\nThe epitaph on Pratt's gravestone reads:\n\nWHILE MEMBER OF CONGRESS\nMOVED THE REDUCTION OF POSTAGE\nA.D. 1838\nAND THE SURVEY FOR A RAILROAD\nTO THE PACIFIC A.D. 1844\n\nmember of the State Senate in 1830; elected as a Democrat to the Twenty-fifth Congress (March 4, 1837 – March 3, 1839); elected to the twenty-eighth Congress (March 4, 1843 – March 3, 1845); chairman, Committee on Public Buildings and Grounds (twenty-eighth Congress).\n\nZadock Pratt's wives\nPratt had five wives throughout his life.\n\nHis first wife was Beda Dickerman, whom he married in 1818.  She died of tuberculosis seven months later.  In 1821 Pratt married his first wife's sister, Esther Dickerman.  Esther died two and a half years later, also from tuberculosis.  Pratt married his third wife, Abigail P. Watson of Rensselaerville, on January 12, 1829. Pratt had his only children with Abigail, a boy and two girls.  George Watson Pratt was born on April 18, 1830.  Zadock's first daughter, Julia P. Pratt, was born in 1832. Two years later his second daughter, Abigail Watson Pratt, was born on January 26, 1834.  On February 5, 1834 Abigail, Pratt's third wife, died at twenty-eight years old due to complications from the birth of her daughter, who also died shortly thereafter at age 3 months.  Some time later, Pratt married Abigail's sister Mary.  They were married until July 17, 1868 when Mary died of unknown causes.  One year later Pratt married his fifth wife, Susie A. Grimms of Brooklyn, October 16, 1869.  They were married in Grace Episcopal Church, Prattsville; Zadock had given the land and half the money to build the church.  They remained married until Zadock's death.\n\nLater life and death\n\nIn 1856, Zadock Pratt, at 66 years old, met a teenage Jay Gould, and hired him to survey a tanning site in Pennsylvania.  Gould found large tracts of hemlock forest for sale, which impressed Pratt, who then made Gould a partner and manager of the new tannery. By another account, Gould decided that he wanted to build a tannery, found a site, and then sought out Pratt's assistance.\n\nThere was $120,000 capital for the project, all of which came from Pratt. He left the tannery to Gould, which expanded rapidly, and the surrounding settlement was called Gouldsboro (also spelled Gouldsborough). However, Pratt became dissatisfied with the returns on his investment, and was concerned that Gould was embezzling. Gould had become acquainted with Charles M. Leupp, a rich merchant from New York City, and had convinced Leupp to loan him the money to buy out Pratt's share. Gould offered Pratt $60,000 for his share of the tannery, which Pratt accepted, transferring Pratt's stake to Leupp.\n\nIn 1861, Pratt donated to Prattsville the  where Pratt Rock now is.\n\nDeath\nPratt became ill with a fever while he and his wife were visiting relatives in Bergen, New Jersey, which had recently been annexed by Jersey City. While recovering he fell down stairs and broke his thigh. He died due to the injury on April 6, 1871. He is buried in the City Cemetery in Prattsville.  Pratt Rock depicts his life through a series of stone carvings.  His former home at Prattsville, the Zadock Pratt House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986, and has operated as a house museum since 1959.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nBooks\n\nNewspaper articles\n\nWebsites\n\nExternal links\n \n The Zadock Pratt Museum\n Zadock Pratt Biographical Information\n\n1790 births\n1871 deaths\nPeople from Stephentown, New York\nDemocratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives from New York (state)\nPrattsville, New York\nTanners\nPeople from Greene County, New York\nAmerican city founders\n19th-century American politicians\nAccidental deaths from falls\nAccidental deaths in New Jersey",

        "The Mokroluški Creek ( / Mokroluški potok, \"Mokri Lug Creek\") is a stream in north-central Serbia, which forms a  former right tributary to the Sava river. During its entire course, it runs through the urban section of Belgrade. It is one of the 40 rivers, streams and creeks that flow or used to flow through Belgrade, but the majority of them are conducted underground into the city sewage system which is also the case with Mokroluški potok.\n\nCourse \n\nThe Mokroluški potok originates in Belgrade's eastern neighborhood of Veliki Mokri Lug, in the municipality of Zvezdara, which also gives the name to the stream (Mokri Lug stream). The Mokroluški potok flows generally in a north-west direction and its valley is used as a route for the Belgrade-Niš highway (constructed 1967-74). After it passes the cemetery of the neighboring Mali Mokri Lug, it reaches the neighborhood of Medaković III where the stream is conducted underground for the first time. The channeled mouth of the stream is still visible under the Gazela Bridge.\n\nAfter an underground flow of about one kilometer, the stream resurfaces in the neighborhood of Medaković II, but one kilometer later, in the neighborhood of Marinkova Bara, it goes underground again. Formerly, it used to flow through the neighborhoods of Dušanovac, Autokomanda and Jatagan Mala. The area in the lower valley of the now underground stream was used for digging earth and gravel which were used to cover and drain the swamps on the Sava's right bank, so that neighborhoods of Savamala and Bara Venecija could be constructed, and for the building of Belgrade's central railway station. After the works were completed, the area around Mokroluški potok was left as a steep, elongated cut in the ground and so was given its present name (Prokop).\n\nThe stream was mostly conducted underground in the 1970s. Before it was channeled, the stream often flooded the area of Dušanovac and Marinkova Bara during the heavy rains, as it was where it received two tributaries, Duboki potok from the north and Kumodraški potok, from the south.\n\nCharacteristics \n\nThe valley of the creek was a route for the Roman aqueduct, which conducted the waters from the Mokri Lug area to the Singidunum castrum. At some point, it received waters from another aqueduct, from the left, which originated in the modern neighborhood of Kumodraž. Both Mokri Lug and Kumodraž are located on the hills, so the natural inclination allowed for the water to flow downhill to Singidunum.\n\nAt Mostar, before flowing into the Sava, northern slopes of Senjak hill descended to the streams left bank. Up to the 19th century, the slope was known as Zamastir. Czech émigré Heinrich Smutek, arranged a large estate (with a brickyard) and a garden in the area, and opened a kafana \"Smutekovac\". As it became highly popular with the Belgraders, the name Zamastir was in time replaced with Smutekovac. The slope above the stream became one of the main excursion areas for the citizens. In the 1870s the area was purchased and parceled by Đorđe Vajfert who opened the brewery in 1872.\n\nThough undistinguished in terms of hydrology, the stream was important in Belgrade geography, while in architecture it has been described as the \"key topology character of Belgrade's history\". Its valley serves as the route for the highway. A small bridge (most) over the stream, near its mouth into the Sava, gave name to the local kafana \"Mostar\" after which, in turn, the entire neighborhood was named Mostar. In architecture, \"the narrative of the Belgrade's terrain ended steeply at the (stream's) line, finalizing the development of Sava amphitheater and marking the edge of the city in its next spreading to the south, further from the Belgrade Fortress and the Trench (which surrounded it)\".\n\nReferences \n\nRivers of Serbia\nGeography of Belgrade\nŠumadija\nVoždovac\nZvezdara",

        "Dicentra peregrina (Japanese コマクサ komakusa) is a herbaceous perennial growing from a rhizome, native to mountains in Japan and nearby areas of East Asia.\n\nEtymology\nThe species name peregrina is Latin for \"exotic, alien, foreign, strange, from foreign lands\", possibly because the species is the only one of its genus outside of North America.\n\nIn Japanese, the plant (kusa) is named for the buds, which look like the head of a horse (koma).\n\nDescription\nLeaves are gray-green, glaucous, and deeply cut, with linear lobes.\n\nFlowers have four rose-purple, pink, cream, pale yellow, or white petals and two tiny sepals. Outer petals are pouched at the base and strongly bent back at the ends. Inner petals are long and protruding, connected at the end.\n\nEcology\nKomakusa grows in Japan, the Kuril Islands, Sakhalin Island, and northeastern Siberia, including the Kamchatka Peninsula. It favors gravelly soil at high altitudes, , in alpine tundra.\n\nCultivars\n\nThere are several hybrid cultivars, cultivated as ornamental plants, involving Dicentra eximia, Dicentra formosa, and Dicentra nevadensis.\nDicentra 'Candy Hearts' (D. eximia × D. peregrina)rose-pink flowers\nDicentra 'Gothenburg' (D. formosa subsp. oregana × D. peregrina f. alba) – light pink flowers\nDicentra 'Ivory Hearts' (D. eximia × D. peregrina)white flowers\nDicentra 'King of Hearts' – D. peregrina × (D. formosa subsp. oregana × D. eximia)pink flowers\nDicentra 'Luxuriant' (D. eximia × D. peregrina)cherry-red flowers\nDicentra 'Tsuneshigo Rokujo' (D. nevadensis × D. peregrina)pink flowers\n\nReferences\n\n Bleeding hearts, Corydalis, and their relatives.

        "The Crucifixion of St. Peter is a fresco painting by the Italian Renaissance master Michelangelo Buonarroti (c. 1546–1550). It is housed in the Cappella Paolina, Vatican Palace, in the Vatican City, Rome. It is the last fresco executed by Michelangelo.\n\nThe artist portrayed St. Peter in the moment in which he was raised by the Roman soldiers to the cross. Michelangelo concentrated the attention on the depiction of pain and suffering. The faces of the people present are clearly distressed. Pope Paul commissioned this fresco by Michelangelo in 1541 and unveiled it in his Cappella Paolina.\n\nRestoration of the fresco completed in 2009 revealed an image believed to be a self-portrait of Michelangelo himself. The figure is standing in the upper left corner of the fresco, wearing a red tunic and a blue turban.  Blue turbans were often worn by Renaissance sculptors to keep the dust out of their hair.\n\nSt. Peter\nSt. Peter is known by his many attributes, as “rock of the church,” the “first vicar of Christ,” or the first Pope. These attributes, specially the latter, made him the subject of many works of art in the Vatican. St Peter is depicted receiving the keys to the kingdom of Heaven from Christ on the wall of the Sistine chapel in Perugino’s The Delivery of the Keys. Pope Paul III commissioned Michelangelo to paint yet another fresco of St Peter around the year 1545.  In contrast to themes of power and glory depicted by Perugino, Michelangelo elected to paint a much darker moment in the saint’s life. St Peter’s status as a major martyr is not only because he was the “first vicar of Christ,” but also because he was, like Christ, crucified. Although his final request is not mentioned in the canonical New Testament, it was popularly believed (due to the Apocryphal text known as the Acts of Peter) that he demanded: Crucify me head downwards, for I am not worthy to die as my master died. The Crucifixion fresco is situated on the eastern wall of the Pauline Chapel, which is significant because that is the location in which the cardinals have always held their elections for a new pope.\n\nFormal analysis and compositional elements\nThe backdrop to the scene is a minimally elaborated mountainous background. Michelangelo did not render this background in great detail. Vasari states, “There are no landscapes to be seen in these scenes, nor any trees, buildings or other embellishments and variation.” The mountains are painted in a faint blue hue, which perhaps is intended to increase the depth of field through atmospheric perspective. The land represented in the middle ground and foreground is a pale yellow-green that is in some places more of a yellow ochre in color. The only real vertical elements in the painting are the figures, which occupy most of the foreground. Many clusters of people surround a single large central figure that is mounted on a crucifix.  The most impressive formal attribute of this painting (besides its considerable size) is its central compositional element. Unlike the many prior representations of the martyrdom of Peter, this one depicts the raising of the cross- the moment before the crucifixion has truly begun. \nThe angle of the crucifix activates the composition and creates much more dynamism in what might otherwise be a static image. The strong diagonal creates a cyclical visual pattern for the eyes to follow. If one reads the painting from left to right, the figures ascending the steps on the bottom left lead the eye upward towards a cluster of equestrian figures. They direct the eye to the group of people located on the top right corner, which in turn lead to one end of the crucifix. The other end of the crucifix points again to the men who are climbing up the steps. Michelangelo also created many strong diagonals with the placement of his figures and the extension of their arms and legs towards a central point of convergence. The position of St Peter's body in this work is often noted as Michelangelo's most interesting innovation. He defied convention by placing Peter's upper body so that he needs to crane upward and twist his neck to make eye contact with the viewer's gaze. This is a far cry from the painted visages of the final moments of countless martyrs, which is typically a passive uplifted gaze. The saint's penetrating stare suggests that he demands the witness of his audience; he demands their focus and gaze, and beseeches that his sacrifice not be deemed in vain.\n\nCriticism\nThese frescoes initially were derided from the very moment of their unveiling.  Most of the criticism focused on what was considered a blatant disregard for proportion. Some attributed the failure of these frescoes to the artist's advancing age and declining health. Later, some scholars attributed the disproportionate nature of the figures to a Michelangelo's active pursuit of mannerist technique. Steinberg refutes these claims by positing the fact that the characteristic stocky, muscular figures in this piece do not coincide with the lithe ideal body type preferred by mannerists.  Yael Even states that Michelangelo even went so far as to imbue the mourning female figures present in the painting with a more masculine quality.\n\nNewer interpretations\nThese frescoes were largely ignored for centuries and incurred a great deal of damage due to neglect. In the early twentieth century there were some scholars who came to reconsider the frescoes under the new light of expressionism and abstraction.  The frescoes were restored in 1934 as a result of this newfound interest and the subsequent appreciation the paintings garnered.  It was not until fairly recently (in the late 1980s) that a scholar by the name of William Wallace proposed an entirely new perspective on the subject. Wallace claims that the disproportionate quality of the figures is not a failing on the part of Michelangelo, but rather another instance of his genius. It is not even an instance of something new. In this particular case, Michelangelo used proportion in order to compensate for certain discrepancies caused by different perspectives. He designed the frescoes in accordance to what the viewer on the ground would see rather than the “ideal” frontal view most people see in photographs or reproductions.  This proclivity for manipulating proportions for the sake of perspective or aggrandizing effects is something Michelangelo is known for. He has notably employed these methods with the Moses statue he carved for the tomb of Pope Julius II.\n\nTime and space\nAccording to Wallace, the real innovation in this piece comes from the incorporation of time and space in the overall composition of the frescos. He postulates that Michelangelo designed the composition for these frescoes with the notion that they would be viewed as one walks down the center aisle of the narrow chapel in a processional manner. The appearance of both frescoes changes significantly as one walks from one end of the chapel to the other.  The most popular point of contention in the case of The Crucifixion of St. Peter is the inordinately large representation of Peter himself. While Peter is in fact grossly disproportionate from the “ideal” frontal view, he is perfectly proportionate (and more important, always visible) from every other vantage point. Michelangelo actually used perspective to make the image something one can experience over time, giving it a somewhat “cinematic quality.”\n\nArchitectural and environmental context\nWallace states that in addition to conceiving of these frescoes in terms of perspective, Michelangelo also took into consideration the architectural and environmental context they were to be set in. The Conversion of St. Saul (or St. Paul) is often discussed in conjunction with The Crucifixion of St. Peter. In large part this is because the two frescoes were commissioned together, but this can also be attributed to how the two images were created as foils of one another. The Conversion of St. Paul (as its title suggests) represents the conversion of a lawyer from Tarsus named Saul (a man who prosecuted Christians) into a follower of Christ.  In the book of Acts Paul states that he saw an impossibly bright light and heard the voice of Christ himself.  The blindingly bright light is the Apex of this story; it is because of this that Michelangelo chose to situate this painting on the Western wall with the eastern exposure – so that the lunette situated above The Crucifixion of St. Peter would provide a bright light to illuminate it throughout the day. Conversely, with The Crucifixion of St. Peter being a much darker story, it is situated on the eastern wall that faces west. Due to the obstruction caused by an adjacent building, this fresco is only lit for a very limited period of time at the very end of the day.  Some speculate that this is part of the reason why it has been overlooked for so long. Wallace proposes that Michelangelo intended for this contrasting darkness to highlight the severity of the subject matter.\n\nLimited accessibility\nUltimately, despite the efforts of contemporary scholars to illustrate the genius behind these works, they remain relatively obscure. This is due primarily to the fact that tourists are not permitted to enter the Pauline chapel because it is a sacred space. Most of those who do know of these works will never have the opportunity to see them in person. According to Williams no other work by Michelangelo has ever been so grossly misrepresented in reproductions. The only way to view these works as the artist intended them to be seen is to see them in situ.\n\nSee also\nList of works by Michelangelo\nThe Conversion of Saul (Michelangelo)\nWilliam Blake\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \"Narrative and Religious Expression in Michelangelo's Pauline Chapel\"\n \"Designed for Ceremony: The Capella Paolina at the Vatican Palace\"\n \"The Heroine as Hero in Michelangelo's Art\"\n \"The First Two Projects of Michelangelo's Tomb of Julius II\"\n Virtual Tour of the Pauline Chapel\n \"Designed for Ceremony: The Cappella Paolina at the Vatican Palace\"\n\nReligious paintings by Michelangelo\n1540s paintings\nFresco paintings in Rome\nChristian art about death\nPaintings depicting Saint Peter\nHorses in art\nTorture in art",

        "The Eocene Okanagan Highlands or Eocene Okanogan Highlands  are a series of Early Eocene geological formations which span a  transect of British Columbia, Canada, and Washington state, United States. Known for a highly diverse and detailed plant and animal paleobiota the paleolake beds as a whole are considered one of the great Canadian Lagerstätten.  The paleobiota represented are of an upland subtropical to temperate ecosystem series immediately after the Paleocene–Eocene thermal maximum, and before the increased cooling of the middle and late Eocene to Oligocene.  The fossiliferous deposits of the region were noted as early as 1873, with small amounts of systematic work happening in the 1870–1920s on British Columbian sites, and 1920–1930s for Washington sites. Focus and more detailed descriptive work on the Okanagan Highland sites started in the late 1960s.\n\nExtent\n \nThe majority of the paleolake deposits are compression fossils in lake bed sediments spanning a  transect, which have been grouped informally into \"Northern\", \"Central\", and \"Southern\" sites.  The Northern sites are composed of unnamed Ootsa Group formations which outcrop as the \"Driftwood shales\" near Smithers, British Columbia, and the \"Horsefly shales\", of an unnamed formation and unnamed group which outcrop around Horsefly, British Columbia.  The Central sites represent Kamloops Group formations with the McAbee Fossil Beds, Tranquille River site and Falkland site, all in the Tranquille Formation, the Quichena site and Stump Lake site in the Coldwater Beds and outcrops of the Chu Chua Formation near Barriere, British Columbia.  The Southern sites include the Princeton Group Allenby Formation sites surrounding Princeton, British Columbia, such as \"Nine Mile Creek\", \"One Mile Creek\", \"Pleasant Valley\", \"Thomas Ranch\", \"Vermilian Bluffs\", and \"Whipsaw Creek\".  The most southerly of the Okanagan Highlands lakes, the Klondike Mountain Formation in Northern Ferry County, Washington, include the \"Boot Hill site\", \"Corner Lot site\", \"Gold Mountain site\", \"Knob Hill site\", and \"Mount Elizabeth site\". Closely correlated with the Klondike Mountain Formation are the Penticton groups Kettle River, Marama and Marron Formations in the Boundary District along the Canada–United States border.\n\nThere is debate as to the affiliation of the, now lost, Quesnel sites with the Greater Okanagan Highlands.  Archibald et al (2018) in the monograph overview of the Highlands Hymenoptera included them as part of the series.  However the certainty for the placement was later questioned by Archibald and Cannings (2022) who opted to tentatively exclude Quesnel from the highlands while discussing the history of field collecting in the region.\n\nHistory\n\nThe earliest geological work in south and central British Columbian sites was during exploratory expeditions under the leadership of George Mercer Dawson in the mid-1870s to document the coal and mineral resources of British Columbia. During the 1875 field work, fossil collections were made in the Quesnel region. Two years later, in 1877, the expedition explored the Okanagan, Nicola, and North Thompson valleys with field collecting along areas of the Similkameen River, Whipsaw Creek and Nine-Mile Creek, north at around Quilchena, and at several areas near Kamloops. These expeditions resulted in a series of papers on the plants, authored by John William Dawson, later David Pearce Penhallow and Edward Wilber Berry. The insects were first detailed by Samuel Hubbard Scudder, with follow-up papers by Anton Handlirsch. While reporting on additional plant fossils collected from British Columbia, Penhallow (1906) noted the likely coeval status of the Princeton basins with many of the sites now considered the Okanagan Highlands. The first brief work on fish from the Highlands occurred with the 1893 report by Edward Drinker Cope on several fish sent to him by George Dawson from the Tranquille and Princeton areas.  While Cope deemed the Tranquille specimens too incomplete to identify, he did provide the description for \"Amyzon\" brevipinne from the Similkameen River fossils.\n\nRepublic, Washington, area fossils were first reported by Joseph Umpleby (1910), based on fish he collected near the Tom Thumb mine, and given a tentative late Miocene age. Two of the fish were figured and briefly mentioned 7 years later by Charles R. Eastman, who assigned them tentatively to \"Amyzon\" brevipinne, making one of the early connections between Republic and the British Columbian sites. Report of the plant fossils of the Republic area were first published by Berry (1929) who included the Republic fossils as part of the Latah Formation.  The inclusion within an expanded Latah Formation was questioned by Roland W. Brown in 1936, who noted the similarities between Republic and other older fossil sites, combined with the Republic lake bed's overlying basalts then thought to be of similar age to the Columbia River Basalts.  This similarity was again noted by Chester A. Arnold during his review of the conifer flora associated with the Princeton basin. Arnold noted the Allenby sites shared over half of the taxa that had been previously reported from Republic. \n\nStarting in the early 1960s and extending through the 1980s were a series of papers on the British Columbian sites combining palynology and the newly devised process of potassium–argon dating to better understand the  geochronology of the sites. The first report of K–Ar dating at a group of sites was by Glenn E. Rouse and William H. Mathews (1961) who tested biotite samples from four locations. They sampled volcanic ashes from Princeton and Rock Creek; a Trachyte flow from Savona Mountain and a diabase flow or sill from Tranquille, returning results of , then classified as Early Middle Eocene. They noted the very distinct similarities with the Republic flora, as Arnold had, and posited that the Republic fossils were of the same age, and not Oligocene as then considered. Based on the estimated age, the sites were noted to be coeval with the Green River Formation but that the floras of the two regions were drastically different, and that more study was needed. \n\nThe term \"Okanagan Highlands\" for Eocene formations of the region was coined by Wesley Wehr and Howard Schorn in a 1992 Washington Geology paper on the conifer research at Republic. The name was derived from the current Okanagan Highlands but applied to the, as then identified, microthermal forests preserved at Republic and Princeton.  The term was expanded upon, and by 2005 it was generally understood to encompass all Eocene fossiliferous formations between Republic and Smithers, British Columbia. The highlands as a whole have been described as one of the \"Great Canadian Lagerstätten\" based on the diversity, quality and unique nature of the biotas that are preserved. The highlands temperate biome, preserved across a large transect of lakes, recorded many of the earliest appearances of modern genera, while also documenting the last stands of ancient lines.\n\nPreservation types\n\nThe majority of formations in the Eocene Okanagan Highlands preserve compression fossils in sandstone to shale rock deposited from lake environments where seasonal mixing and anoxia were prevalent. Additionally, two important non-compression biotas are present in the Eocene Okanagan Highlands:  A permineralized chert flora, the Princeton Chert is found along the Similkameen River interbedded with coal deposits of the Ashnola shale unit, Allenby Formation, known for anatomically preserved plants.  In the Central sites, subbituminous coal of the Hat Creek Coal Formation around Hat Creek hosts an amber fauna, the Hat Creek amber which preserves many small insects that would likely not be found in the compression biotas.\n\nPaleoclimate\n\nBased on paleobotanical proxies and geochemical data, the highlands are thought to have been between  in elevation, placing them similar to or higher than the modern sites. Estimates of the mean annual temperature have been derived from climate leaf analysis multivariate program (CLAMP) analysis and leaf margin analysis (LMA) of both the Princeton and Republic paleofloras. The CLAMP results, after multiple linear regressions for Republic, gave a mean annual temperature of approximately , while the LMA gave .  Princeton's multiple linear regression CLAMP results gave a slightly lower , and the LMA returned a mean annual temperature of .  This is lower than the mean annual temperature estimates given for the coastal Puget Group, which is estimated to have been between .  The bioclimatic analysis for Republic and Princeton suggest mean annual precipitation amounts of  and  respectively.\n\nThe warm temperate uplands floras of the highlands, associated with downfaulted lacustrine basins and active volcanism are noted to have no exact modern equivalents, due to the more seasonally equitable conditions of the Early Eocene.  However, the highlands have been compared to the upland ecological islands in the Virunga Mountains within the Albertine Rift of the African rift valley.\n\nPaleobiota\n\nThe Eocene Okanagan Highlands hosted a diverse mix of temperate and tropical paleobiotic elements, with the forests having the first significant proportions of temperate plants in North America.\n\nThe paleobotanical community was a mixture of plants found in subtropical evergreen and temperate deciduous forests.  Included in the forest were a number of important modern temperate flowering plant families such as Betulaceae, Rosaceae, and Sapindaceae, plus the conifer family Pinaceae. Study of the deciduous plants from the highlands has documented the occurrence of heteromorphic leaves derived from sun versus shade conditions and long shoot or short shoot buds.  The paleobotanical community of the Republic area has been noted as the most diverse floral community of the Okanagan Highlands, with some estimates ranging to over 68 families and 134 genera being present.\n\nReferences\n\nGeology of the Rocky Mountains\nPaleogene geology of Washington (state)\nPaleontology in Washington (state)\nYpresian North America\nPaleontology in British Columbia",

        "The Fijnschilders (literally \"fine-painters\"), also called the Leiden Fijnschilders ('Leidse Fijnschilders'), were Dutch Golden Age painters who, from about 1630 to 1710, strove to create as natural a reproduction of reality as possible in their meticulously executed, often small-scale works. \n\nAlthough in the seventeenth century, as in modern Dutch, the term fijnschilder was used to differentiate between a painter practicing classic techniques and one who, for instance, is a house painter, in the nineteenth century it became a label for artists like Gerrit Dou and his followers in Leiden. Dou, Frans van Mieris, Sr. and Adriaen van der Werff—all among the most successful of the Dutch Baroque—became identifiable by their \"fine\" manner, exquisite techniques, and extreme attention to detail resulting in works with smooth surfaces completely lacking painterly brush strokes. The application of paint contrasts with the textures and style of other Dutch painters, such as Frans Hals and Dou's teacher Rembrandt van Rijn. In this way they have more in common with earlier traditions in Netherlandish painting, such as the detailed richness of Jan van Eyck. Other artists working in the style include Godfried Schalcken, Quirijn van Brekelenkam, Pieter Leermans and, at times, Gabriel Metsu.\n\nThe fijnschilders are best known for genre scenes showing everyday life and activities, candle-lit nocturnal subjects, and trompe-l'œil \"niche\" paintings.\n\nReferences\n Leidse fijnschilders: van Gerrit Dou tot Frans van Mieris de Jonge 1630-1760, Leiden, Stedelijk Museum de Lakenhal, 1988\n\nArt movements in Dutch painting\nArt of the Dutch Golden Age",

        "Ravenswood School of Arts is a heritage-listed school of arts at Macrossan Street, Ravenswood, Charters Towers Region, Queensland, Australia. It was built in 1884. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.\n\nHistory \nThe School of Arts building is a timber hall, built in 1884 beside a former School of Arts structure then used as a library. It became the principal theatre, cinema, and social venue of Ravenswood and continued a series of facilities provided to the community of Ravenswood since 1872.\n\nRavenswood was one of several important goldfields in which formed a major component in the development of North Queensland. The need to access and exploit gold finds determined the path of railways, the establishment of related industries and commerce and the location of settlements. Some of these were short lived \"rushes\", where tent and shanty townships disappeared almost as quickly as they rose. Other settlements based on goldfields became established towns with government and civic buildings, shops and family homes and survived as such. A few became important centres, only to fade away as gold yields fell. Ravenswood was one of these.\n\nThe area was first settled by Europeans following the establishment of Bowen in 1861. Pastoral runs were soon set up in the hinterland, including the area on which the Ravenswood field was to develop. The first gold in North Queensland had been found at Star River in 1865 and triggered further exploration. Gold was found at Merri Merriwa, the run on which the town of Ravenswood stands, in 1867, although it was reported as being on the adjoining property of Ravenswood, the name by which the field was always known.\n\nMuch of the gold initially found was in a triangle in and around three dry creeks which soon formed the focus for a tent and shanty settlement. Ravenswood gold was in reefs and a small battery was first set up in 1869, followed by the Lady Marian Mill in 1870. The settlement was also surveyed at this time, but by then the goldfield itself, and the buildings and streets already established, had shaped the town and the survey merely formalised what was already in place. This can still be seen clearly in the irregularity of the major streets. Ravenswood was gazetted as a town in 1871.\n\nIt was soon found that the gold at deeper levels was finely distributed in ore containing other minerals and was difficult to separate either by mechanical or chemical means. This required greater capital to fund various technologies for extraction. Many miners left for other fields, such as Charters Towers, discovered in 1871 and which quickly overtook Ravenswood as a gold producer and as the most important inland North Queensland town. Even so, Ravenswood continued to prosper due to a steady, though reduced, production of gold, the discovery of silver at nearby Totley in 1878 and as a commercial centre. By 1874, the town had a courthouse and police station, a post and telegraph office, a hospital and a school. In 1872, the first small School of Arts was formed, providing a lending library, newspapers and a meeting place for its members and in 1875 a separate library building was constructed beside it.\n\nThe first Mechanics' Institutes or Schools of Arts were established in Britain in the early 1800s and were intended to assist self-improvement and to promote moral, social and intellectual growth, by providing lectures, discussions and lending libraries to a rising middle class. At the time there were no public libraries and books were expensive, so that access to books by borrowing as subscribers provided an important educational and recreational service. The first School of Arts committee in Queensland was established in Brisbane in 1849 with the aim of \"the advancement of the community in literary, philosophic and scientific subjects\". As towns and districts became established, local committees were formed to establish schools of arts and they became one of the principal sources of adult education.\n\nRavenswood's economy received a boost in the mid 1880s by the arrival of the railway in 1884 and the use of improved means to extract gold from ore. A new generation of public buildings began to replace those from the early days of the field, including a police station and courthouse, post office and hospital. In 1884, the current hall was built beside the library, presumably replacing the first small hall. In the late nineteenth century Schools of Arts expanded their aims to include the promotion of games of skill and intellectual amusements. The new hall provided the facilities for the staging of plays and concerts and became a focal point of entertainment for townspeople. It was used as a meeting hall, dance hall and a live theatre. An amateur dramatic society staged annual productions and a School concert and St Patrick's Day concert were annual events. . In 1899, the New Ravenswood Company was formed by Archibald Laurence Wilson who raised overseas capital, reopened old mines and used modern methods to rework tailings more efficiently. The shareholders recouped their investment in the first two years and this drew world-wide interest. It was the beginning of Ravenswood's most prosperous period, which lasted for several years. However, after 1908, the cost of extraction and continued exploration grew as returns lessened and after the end of World War I, it became apparent that it would not pick up again. In 1916 rail services were cut and in 1917 the New Ravenswood Company closed.\n\nIn the 1920s, buildings as well as people left Ravenswood, as timber buildings were relocated in other towns. There was a small revival in the 1930s and early 1940s as new technology allowed for economical mining of lower grade ores. However, by the 1960s, the population fell to 70. This was to be its lowest level, as tourists began to take an interest in the town, studies were made of the buildings and work began to conserve them. In the 1980s the whole town was listed by the Australian Heritage Commission and the National Trust of Queensland. In 1987 Carpentaria Gold Ltd opened a new open cut mine using modern heap leaching processes.\n\nIn 1989 Cyclone Aivu damaged the facade of the hall and caused the complete collapse of the library. This building was propped by the community, but eventually demolished in 1992 as it was thought unsafe. The hall was repaired and the front reconstructed to resemble its original appearance. In 1990 the Dalrymple Shire Council and Carpentaria Gold financed extensive renovations to the hall. Its official opening took place on Sunday 29 September 1991, since when it has again become a focus for community activities and celebrations including the \"Back To Ravenswood Weekend\" held each year.\n\nDescription \n\nThe School of Arts is located on Macrossan Street, the main street of Ravenswood. It is on the edge of the town's commercial centre and close to the Imperial Hotel. Ravenswood is located in a mining landscape which consists of disturbed ground with scattered ruins and mullock heaps, set amongst distinctive chinkee apples and rubber vines.\n\nThe School of Arts is a single storey, rectangular timber building set on low concrete stumps. It is rectangular in plan with its long axis at right angles to the street and has a gabled roof clad in corrugated iron. The sides and back have an exposed stud frame but the front is weatherboard clad. The facade is symmetrical and divided into bays by pilasters. The arched parapet is echoed by the arched heads of the central front door and the double hung windows which flank it.\n\nThe interior features a large open space and a stage. The stage curtain has been preserved and is decorated with painted advertisements for local businesses dating from around the turn of the century, reflecting its use as a community building.\n\nHeritage listing \nRavenswood School of Arts was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.\n\nThe Ravenswood School of Arts is important as an element in the network of Schools of Arts which sprang up in any town of consequence in Queensland during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. They were community based and played a valuable educational and social role in the dissemination of information and the provision of facilities for lectures, meetings, games of skill and the staging of community events such as plays and concerts.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.\n\nIt is a good example of a School of Arts hall with a classically influenced facade and the provision of facilities for public events.\n\nThe place is important because of its aesthetic significance.\n\nThe building is a significant as part of the townscape of Ravenswood because of its location within a group of other public and commercial buildings, close to the town centre.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nThe painted stage curtain carrying advertisements for local firms around the turn of the century reflects its importance as a building used by the community.\n\nThe School of Arts is important for its connection with the community of Ravenswood as an integral part of the social and community life of the town.\n\nReferences\n\nAttribution\n\nExternal links \n\nQueensland Heritage Register\nRavenswood, Queensland\nSchools of Arts in Queensland\nArticles incorporating text from the Queensland Heritage Register\nSchool buildings completed in 1884",

In 1971 he joined the Laboratory of Infectious Diseases where he co-identified the Hepatitis A virus (HAV) in 1973. The same team developed the first assays that could measure the virus antigen and antibody, and using those assays, the group along with Harvey J. Alter demonstrated through the serologic exclusion of Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B that a third, previously unrecognised form of viral hepatitis existed, originally named non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH). Michael Houghton's laboratory at Chiron Corporation ultimately identified the agent associated with NANBH, now known as Hepatitis C, in 1989.\n\nReferences\n\nYear of birth missing (living people)\nLiving people\nJohns Hopkins University alumni\nUniversity of Tennessee alumni\nAmerican virologists\n20th-century American scientists",

Llwydcoed\n\nCareer\nPhillips began his career at Cardiff City, making his debut in a 3–2 win over Hartlepool United in February 1997 as a replacement for Scott Young. During the following years he found opportunities hard to come by at the club before moving on to League of Wales outfit Barry Town in 2000 where he made just under 100 appearances including some appearances in European competition.\n\nHe then moved to Football Conference side Forest Green Rovers before returning to Wales to sign for Newport County. In June 2005 he signed for Llanelli, captaining them to the league title before joining Port Talbot Athletic in June 2008. However, he made a controversial return to Llanelli just 27 days later.

        "was a Japanese joshi puroresu professional wrestler. She worked for native companies in her country such as World Wonder Ring Stardom from 2016 to 2020, and Wrestle-1, in addition to having made appearances for foreign companies such as Ring of Honor, Pro-Wrestling: EVE, and some independent promotions in Mexico. Kimura was a second-generation wrestler; her mother Kyoko Kimura is a former professional wrestler.\n\nShe was a cast member on the Fuji Television and Netflix reality television series Terrace House: Tokyo 2019–2020, which is the fifth installment of the Terrace House franchise. Following a series of troubling tweets addressing online bullying directed at her from Terrace House viewers, she was found dead in her apartment in Tokyo on May 23, 2020. Her death had been ruled a suicide by December 2020.\n\nProfessional wrestling career\n\nEarly career\nPrior to her professional wrestling career, Kimura won the DDT Ironman Heavymetalweight Championship one time on August 21, 2005, at a live event in Tokyo, then lost the title to her mother Kyoko.\n\nIn the 2010s, Kimura was trained at Wrestle-1's Professional Wrestling University.\n\nWrestle-1 (2016–2019)\nAfter graduating the Wrestle-1 training academy, she debuted for promotion on March 30, 2016, against her classmate, Reika Saiki, in a losing effort. The pair wrestled against each other many times throughout 2016 in Wrestle-1.\n\nOn August 7, 2016, Kimura wrestled against her mother in a match. On September 18, 2016, Kimura captured her first title, the JWP Junior Championship, by defeating Yako Fujigasaki in a tournament final. She lost her JWP Junior Championship on December 28, 2016, to Yako Fujigasaki. On January 22, 2017, her mother retired. In Kyoko's retirement show, Kimura defeated her mother in a singles match and on the same show, the two teamed in a trios match in a winning effort.\n\nDuring 2017, Kimura split her time between Wrestle-1, Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling and Stardom while being a contracted performer for Wrestle-1. Kimura officially became a Wrestle-1 roster member on January 9, 2018. She made an international tour in early 2018, competing for Ring of Honor, Pro-Wrestling: EVE, and various promotions in Mexico.\n\nOn March 21, 2019, Kimura announced she was leaving Wrestle-1.\n\nWorld Wonder Ring Stardom (2016–2020)\n\nOedo Tai (2016-2018) \nOn September 22, 2016, Kimura made her in-ring debut in World Wonder Ring Stardom by teaming up with Kagetsu and Kyoko Kimura to defeat JKGReeeeN and Mayu Iwatani. On October 2, 2016, Kimura teamed with her mother and Kagetsu to capture the Artist of Stardom Championship. Late in 2016, Kimura injured her wrist, which led to her going on a hiatus to recover.\n\nKimura eventually became a member of Stardom's heel stable, Oedo Tai. On June 21, 2017, at Stardom's Galaxy Stars 2017 event, Kimura teamed with her fellow Oedo Tai member, Kagetsu, to win the Goddess of Stardom Championship by defeating Team Jungle (Hiroyo Matsumoto and Jungle Kyona). Kimura and Kagetsu held the titles for nearly a year, successfully defending against teams such as Jungle Kyona and HZK, Io Shirai and Viper, Jungle Kyona and Natsuko Tora, HZK and Momo Watanabe, Mayu Iwatani and Tam Nakano. The team was defeated by Mayu Iwatani and Saki Kashima in 2018.\n\nDuring Kagetsu's final match in the 2018  5 Star Grand Prix on September 24, Kimura betrayed Oedo Tai by attacking Kagetsu with a chair, causing Kagetsu to lose and fail to reach the finals. Following the match, Kimura declared that she was no longer affiliated with Oedo Tai. At Mask Fiesta 2018 on October 28, Kimura, under the ring name Hanita, teamed up with La Maestra in a loss to Candy Skull and Marty Scurll.\n\nTokyo Cyber Squad (2019-2020) \nShe officially joined Stardom on March 25, 2019. On April 6, Kimura, along with Stella Grey and Sumie Sakai wrestled Jenny Rose and Oedo Tai (Kagetsu and Hazuki) in a dark match at Ring of Honor and New Japan Pro-Wrestling's G1 Supercard. On April 14, at the 2019 Stardom draft, Hana was named leader of the International Army faction, later known as Tokyo Cyber Squad. On May 16, Kimura, along with her stablemates Jungle Kyona and Konami won the Artist of Stardom Championship after defeating Mayu Iwatani, Saki Kashima, and Tam Nakano.\n\nOn January 4, 2020, Kimura, along with Giulia wrestled Mayu Iwatani and Arisa Hoshiki in a dark match at New Japan Pro-Wrestling's Wrestle Kingdom 14. It was the first women's match at the Tokyo Dome since 2002. Kimura had her final match on March 24 at Stardom's Cinderella Tournament 2020, wrestling Mayu Iwatani in the first round to a draw.\n\nDuring her Stardom career, she won the Artist of Stardom Championship twice and the Goddess of Stardom championship once, while also winning the 2019 5★Star GP tournament and Stardom Fighting Spirit Award.\n\nAppearance on Terrace House and other ventures\n\nKimura joined the reality television series Terrace House: Tokyo 2019–2020 in September 2019, appearing on the show until her death. One episode filmed in early January 2020 showed Kimura involved in a verbal conflict with her housemate, Kai Edward Kobayashi, for damaging her wrestling attire. After the episode aired in March 2020, her actions drew criticism, name calling and racist abuse from social media users, sending her into depression. The release of new Terrace House episodes was suspended as a result of Kimura's death, and Fuji TV later cancelled the season.\n\nBefore her death, Kimura was set to co-star with Ena Fujita in the music video for the musician's June 2020 single \"Dead Stroke\" and Lalo the Don's \"Til The Break of Don\", recorded before the COVID-19 pandemic and uploaded on YouTube on May 20, 2021.\n\nPersonal life\nKimura was the daughter of Kyoko Kimura, who is also a professional wrestler. Before she was one year old, she was separated from her father. While the identity of Hana Kimura's biological father is not publicly known, Kyoko Kimura has mentioned in interviews that he is an Indonesian national and because of this, Hana Kimura was referred to as Indonesian-Japanese. She was bullied as a child because of her mixed ethnic heritage.\n\nDeath\n\nEarly in the morning of May 23, 2020, Kimura posted self-harm images on Twitter and Instagram while sharing some of the hate comments she received. She was reported dead later that day, at the age of 22. Dave Meltzer claimed three days later that the cause of death was hydrogen sulfide inhalation. By December 2020 the death was ruled a suicide.\n\nOn December 15, 2020, the police announced that they had arrested a man in his mid-20s for cyberbullying. The man, who resides in Osaka Prefecture, admitted to the allegations and was quoted by the police as saying he \"couldn't forgive Kimura's attitude on the program.\" On March 30, 2021, the Tokyo Prosecutors Office indicted the Osaka man for online abuse directed at Kimura, but was not obliged to face trial under the indictment, as is often the case for relatively minor offenses in Japan. He was issued an order of ¥9000 (US$80) fine, which prompted concerns that the punishment was too light.  Kyoko Kimura, the late wrestler's mother, has filed a suit seeking more than $20,000 in damages from the man.\n\nOn April 5, 2021, Tokyo Metropolitan Police charged a second man in his late 30s for online abuse he sent Kimura. Metropolitan Police Department said the second man, from Fukui Prefecture, admitted to the allegations during voluntary questioning, with investigative sources quoting him as saying, \"Many hateful messages had been posted, and I followed suit. I'm sorry.\" When asked why he did it, he said he was \"simply joining in with what he saw others doing on her site.\"\n\nOn January 22, 2021, Kyoko Kimura filed a lawsuit with the Tokyo District Court seeking damages of around 2.94 million yen (US$27,000) against a third man for causing emotional distress to her family. According to the lawsuit, the third man, from Nagano Prefecture, posted hateful messages about Kimura's death in May 2020. On May 19, 2021, the Japanese Court Judge Momoko Ikehara ordered the third man to pay 1.29 million yen (US$12,000).\n\nLegacy and tributes\nOn the day of Kimura's death, several professional wrestling companies such as New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), National Wrestling Alliance, Ring of Honor, All Elite Wrestling, Impact Wrestling, among other companies sent their condolences. During AEW's Double or Nothing pay-per-view event, they paid tribute to Kimura and Shad Gaspard (who also died that same week).\n\nOn the May 27 episode of WWE NXT, Io Shirai and commentator Mauro Ranallo paid tribute to Hana with the following phrase: \"Hana was one of the most talented female wrestlers in the world, and I was looking forward to watching her grow to see how far she could go,\" Io began. \"I will always remember her smile that would brighten up any room she walked into. It is so important that we all love and treat each other with respect.\" On the May 29 episode of WWE SmackDown, Sasha Banks wore a black armband that said \"HANA\" in white letters. On the June 2 episode of WWE Raw, Kairi Sane wrote a message on her umbrella that reads \"花ちゃん、ありがとう\" (Hana-chan, thank you). At NXT TakeOver: In Your House, Dakota Kai sported pink hair that she confirmed was dyed as a tribute to Kimura. On June 21, World Wonder Ring Stardom had its first event during the COVID-19 pandemic and before the event, they paid tribute to Kimura with all the wrestlers around the ringside area for a ten-bell salute. Kimura's fellow Terrace House cast member Peppe drew her in the third volume of his manga series Mingo, which was released on July 10. On the September 3 episode of AEW Dynamite, professional wrestler Kenny Omega wore a Hana Kimura shirt on what would've been her 23rd birthday. The shirt was released on Pro Wrestling Tees with all the proceeds going to Hana's mother, Kyoko. At NJPW's Battle in the Valley on February 18, 2023, Mercedes Moné paid homage to Kimura by wearing an outfit similar to what Kimura wore after leaving Oedo Tai.\n\nOn June 14, 2022, Japan's parliament passed a law in which \"online insults\" were punishable by one year in response to Kimura's online bullying. Offenders convicted of online insults can be jailed for up to one year, or fined 300,000 yen (about $2,200).\n\nHana Kimura Memorial annual shows\nOn March 31, 2021, Kyoko Kimura, Hana's mother launched the non-profit Remember Hana, an anti-bullying organization. As a result, the \"Hana Kimura Memorial\" events series commenced on May 23, 2021, with the Hana Kimura Memorial Show, \"Matane.\" The second show, \"Bagus\", took place on May 23, 2022.\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\nDramatic Dream Team\nIronman Heavymetalweight Championship (1 time)\nJWP Joshi Puroresu\nPrincess of Pro-Wrestling Championship (1 time)\nJWP Junior Championship (1 time)\nJWP Junior Championship Tournament (2016)\nPrincess of Pro-Wrestling Tournament (2016)\nPro Wrestling Illustrated\nRanked No. 60 of the top 100 female wrestlers in the PWI Women's 100 in 2018\nWorld Wonder Ring Stardom\nArtist of Stardom Championship (2 times) – with Jungle Kyona and Konami (1), Kagetsu and Kyoko Kimura (1)\nGoddess of Stardom Championship (1 time) – with Kagetsu\n5★Star GP (2019)\nStardom Year-End Award (2 times)\nBest Tag Team Award (2017) \nFighting Spirit Award (2019)\n\nSee also\nList of premature professional wrestling deaths\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1997 births\n2020 deaths\n2020 suicides\nJapanese female professional wrestlers\nJapanese people of Indonesian descent\nJapanese television personalities\nSportspeople from Yokohama\nVictims of cyberbullying\nSuicides by poison in Japan\nFemale suicides\n21st-century female professional wrestlers\nGoddess of Stardom Champions\nArtist of Stardom Champions\nIronman Heavymetalweight Champions\nJWP Junior Champions\nPrincess of Pro-Wrestling Champions",

        "Summerstown is a district of south-west London located on the boundary between the London Borough of Wandsworth and the London Borough of Merton. It is an area on the north eastern edge of Wimbledon, south of Earlsfield, west of Tooting and north of Collier's Wood. The district is bisected by the A217 and bordered by the River Wandle.\n\nHistory\n\nEvidence of settlement in the area of Summerstown first appears in the late Middle Ages, when the River Wandle was bordered by mills in this area, worked by villagers from the nearby hamlet of Garratt (which gives its name to 'Garratt Lane', the local stretch of the A217). By 1631, ‘Dutchmen’ are recorded as manufacturing kettles and frying pans here, while other Huguenot refugees are thought to have engaged in silk weaving and wig making here.\n\nBy the mid-nineteenth century, this area was becoming increasingly populated, with many of the present day properties being built in the area at this time, notably the St Clement Danes almshouses in 1848–9, which have now become council housing.\n\nThe nineteenth century also saw the construction of Summerstown's parish church, with a chapel being built in 1836, and extended in 1861 and 1870. By 1903, it was apparent that a yet larger church was needed, so the present day St Mary's Church was constructed just off Garratt Lane, where it remains little altered to this day.\n\nThe early twentieth century was a turbulent time for the parish, with the Great War costing the lives of 182 men in the parish, who were memorialised by Summerstown's war memorial, which is located just inside St Mary's Church. In the Second World War, Summerstown was also affected by bombing, particularly in 1944, when a V2 rocket struck Hazelhurst Road, killing 35 and injuring over a hundred. After the war, this presented the council with the opportunity to construct the Hazelhurst estate in 1969–73.\n\nBetween 1961 and 1968, Marc Bolan (then known as Marc Feld) and family lived in Summerstown. He attended Hillcroft School (now Ernest Bevin Academy) and worked part time as a dish washer at the local Wimpy burger bar in Tooting. His time in Summerstown was difficult but formative, with Feld often busking outside the former Prince of Wales pub (now Tesco Express). In 2021, plans to erect a commemorative plaque to mark Bolan's time in the area were announced.\n\nPresent Day\nThe parish church, St Mary's Church, is still open and active in the parish, hosting a service at 10:30 each Sunday morning, and holds a range of services include singing, prayers and a talks from the Bible as well as activities for children.\n\nCommunity project Summerstown 182 identifies and raises awareness of local Summerstown history. Founded by Geoff Simmons, the project has been responsible for erecting plaques in honour of many former residents, including Sidney Lewis, Sadie Crawford and Peter Barr. Summerstown 182 was named one of Sadiq Khan's Community Heroes in 2015.\n\nIt is home to the By The Horns Brewing Co., which stands almost exactly on the site of Marc Bolan's former home. The brewers named an ale, Cosmic Warrior, after the late singer.\n\nThe area was also home to Wimbledon Stadium, a dog racing track that also hosted speedway, stock car and other racing events, which closed in 2017. The New Plough Lane Stadium, home of AFC Wimbledon, was built in its place and opened in November 2020.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nhttps://www.summerstown.org.uk/\nhttps://bythehorns.co.uk/\n\nAreas of London\nDistricts of the London Borough of Merton\nDistricts of the London Borough of Wandsworth",

Produced by Madonna and Diplo, it is an EDM song with lyrics about Madonna having continuous fun because she is Madonna.\n\nThe song divided music critics, as some called it \"energetic\", applauding Minaj's rap verse and its unusual composition, while others criticized it for being \"desperate to shock\". In the United States, \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" became the first Madonna song to enter the Billboard Hot 100 in three years, peaking at number 84. The song became Minaj's 63rd and Madonna's 57th Hot 100 entry, placing them at positions three and four on the list of women with the most entries on the chart up that point. It also reached number-one on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart, extending Madonna's lead as the artist with the most number-ones on the US dance chart. Worldwide, the song has reached the top-thirty in Hungary, and the digital charts of Finland and Sweden.\n\nThe song's accompanying video, directed by Jonas Åkerlund, has Minaj and Diplo appearing alongside Madonna. The video also contains cameos from Diplo, Rita Ora, Chris Rock, Jon Kortajarena, Miley Cyrus, Alexander Wang, Beyoncé, Katy Perry, Kanye West, and Madonna's two sons, Rocco and David. It was shot at the Standard Hotel in New York City and shows Madonna and her entourage having a party throughout the building, ending at the rooftop. The release of the video to the streaming service Tidal was plagued by technical difficulties and was met with a mixed response. Critics complimented the craziness of the clip but panned the absence of the guest stars from the set. Additionally, comparisons ensued with then recently released music video for singer-songwriter Taylor Swift's single \"Bad Blood\", which had featured similar guest stars. In order to further promote the song, Madonna performed \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" during her appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, which was received positively. It was also performed on the Rebel Heart (2015–2016) and Celebration (2023–24) concert tours.\n\nBackground and development \n\nIn February 2014, Madonna announced that she had begun working on her thirteenth studio album, saying \"I'm right now in the process of talking to various co-writers and producers and talking about where I want to go with my music\". By the next month she started posting a number of images on social media website Instagram, where she hinted at possible songwriters and collaborators with hashtag captions. Two months later, Madonna posted a selfie where she talked about working with American DJ Diplo. Madonna had invited him to her annual Oscar party, but he was unable to attend. They eventually started talking about music through texts and decided to collaborate on the album. In an interview with Idolator, Diplo explained that Madonna had asked him to provide his \"craziest record\" for the album. Together they wrote and recorded seven songs and Diplo added that \"[Madonna] was up for anything. I love when an artist gives a producer the confidence he needs to work with them, and [she] was very open-minded to my ideas. Those records are gonna be crazy-sounding. We really pushed the envelope with some of the stuff we were doing.\"\n\nOne of the tracks recorded was confirmed by Diplo as titled \"Bitch I'm Madonna\", which he believed would push his boundaries of songwriting. Madonna explained that the phrase was new to her and was introduced by Diplo, who explained that anyone who could remain cool when faced with criticism was appropriating Madonna, hence it was not just a unique reference to the singer. The origin of the song's idea was traced back to rapper Lil B's 2010 song, \"Pretty Boy Anthem\", which presented the lyrics \"I look like Madonna / Bitch, I'm a farmer\". Diplo took this idea to Madonna and developed a song which addressed the singer's detractors, who spoke negatively about her longevity in the music industry, adding \"We made this record about, 'Fuck it, bitch, we're all Madonna. He also insisted that they recruit rapper Nicki Minaj, who had previously worked with Madonna on two songs, \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\" and \"I Don't Give A\", from her MDNA album.\n\nDiplo explained to Interview magazine that the song's composition happened while they were drinking one night in the studio. There he played Madonna a Japanese pizzicato melody and a drop, which she liked. Since Madonna preferred to start her compositions on guitar, Diplo added guitar sounds over the melody and then progressed with the writing. Another Instagram post by Madonna confirmed Minaj's involvement in the track, with the photo caption \"We go hard or we go home we gon' do this all night long! #werk\". Madonna commented about her method working with Minaj:\nWhenever we work together she always sits with me and listens to the song, and says \"tell me what this song is about to you.\" She's very methodical in her thinking. We talk about it, she writes down words that I say describing what the song's about and the sentiment that I'd like her to get out there, and then she goes away and she works on it. She writes it, she comes back. She does a version of it, we talk about it. It's a back and forth until she gets it right. It's a total collaboration.\n\nRelease \nOn December 17, 2014, Billboard reported that the demo version of \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" had leaked onto the Internet, alongside the other twelve demo recordings for Madonna's then untitled thirteenth studio album. An aggravated Madonna clarified that the songs were demo versions from earlier recordings; she compared the leak to that of \"artistic rape\". She was subsequently criticized for referring to the hack as \"terrorism\" in the wake of the Peshawar school attack and Sydney hostage crisis. On December 20, 2014, the album became available for pre-order on iTunes Store. When ordered, six tracks including \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" were available for digital download. Madonna stated that the songs were meant to be \"an early Christmas gift\" with the final release in March 2015.\n\nFollowing \"Living for Love\" and \"Ghosttown\", \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" was confirmed as the third single from Rebel Heart by Madonna on her Instagram. She also released three remixes of the song on her YouTube and Tidal accounts for streaming. The cover art of the song was also released along with the remixes; it was created from one of her images on Instagram. The majority of house remixes of \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" were produced by Rosabel, Sander Kleinenberg and Oscar G, who posted a message on his Facebook account about the collaboration, \"When Madonna calls you, you do exactly what she asks. I am very grateful for this opportunity!\" Another remix by Sick Individuals, which consist of Dutch duo Rinze \"Ray\" Hofstee and Joep \"Jim\" Smeele, was released exclusively to Billboard. The remixes were first released on June 15, 2015, in Australia and Germany, and the next day in other nations.\n\nComposition and remixes \n\"Bitch I'm Madonna\" was co-written and co-produced by Madonna and Diplo, with other writers including Sophie, MoZella, Toby Gad, Ariel Rechtshaid and Minaj. Demacio \"Demo\" Castellon was the audio engineer for the track and also did the audio mixing and recording. Other engineers who worked on the track included Nick Rowe and Aubrey \"Big Juice\" Delaine, with Zeke Mishanec helping with additional recording and Angie Teo working on additional mixing. The song was the first time that PC Music, which generally catered to underground music and artists, was working with a mainstream artist like Madonna. Sophie recalled that it was Madonna who was \"calling the final shots\" for recording the song and noted that there was no label representative who dictated the process.\n\n\"Bitch I'm Madonna\" has similarities to DJ Snake and Lil Jon's \"Turn Down for What\" (2013) with Madonna's vocals reminiscent of singer Miley Cyrus' autotuned rapping. The song has a \"berserk\", \"bleepy\" and \"churning\" EDM, trap, electro, dubstep and electropop sound. It begins with the sound of acoustic guitar reminiscent of Avicii's single \"Wake Me Up\" (2012), as Madonna coos in the background, \"You're gonna love this\", but quickly transitions \"past stadium-filling EDM into a genre that more commonly fills the headphones of kids surfing obscure music blogs late at night\", as noted by Sasha Geffen, who also compared the sound to the vaporwave genre. The track deviates from a traditional song structure and hook, instead featuring harsh cuts, synths and Madonna singing in a nasal tone. Minaj raps in the track, asking everybody to \"go hard or go home\", while Madonna shouts lyrics like, \"I just wanna have fun tonight, I wanna blow up this house tonight\", \"alternating between pitch-shifted shrieks of 'Who do you think you are??' and the sing-songy title taunt.\" Regarding her profuse usage of the word \"bitch\" in the song (along with another song \"Unapologetic Bitch\" from Rebel Heart), Madonna defended her decision to Billboard, saying:\nI think that's bullshit. The word police can fuck off. I don't want to be policed! I'm not interested in political correctness. The word \"bitch\" means a lot of different things. Everything is about context. When I first moved to England and heard the word \"cunt\", I was horrified. People were calling each other cunts! And then I realized that, in that culture, it was different—they slapped each other on the back and said, \"Who's the cunt, right, you're my best mate!\" The word \"fuck\" doesn't just mean sexual intercourse. I mean, \"You're a stupid fuck\", \"Are you going to fuck with me?\" \"Fuck off!\" ... Sex has nothing to do with any of those expressions, and the same goes for \"bitch\". If I say to you, \"I'm a badass bitch\", I'm owning myself, I'm saying, \"I'm strong, I'm tough, and don't mess with me.\" If I say, \"Why are you being such a bitch to me?\", well, that means something else.\nSince Madonna had to rush-release the first six songs from Rebel Heart due to the hack and leaks, Diplo clarified that the released version on the album was not his final mixing of the track; he later posted his intended cut on his SoundCloud account. Three of the house remixes of \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" were released as dub versions of the song, with a long drawn-out beat section and minimal vocals from Madonna, as noted by Robbie Daw from Idolator. Kleinenberg's remix had a completely different sound from the house mixes, although Daw believed all of them to be \"cheap\" sounding in comparison to the original. According to Sick Individuals, their remix of the song had \"hard-hitting\" beats and it was also an energetic version, catering to the dance floors. Fedde Le Grand's remix of the song did not use any of the effects present in the album version, and was created as an electro house track with metallic sounds.\n\nCritical reception \nThe song divided music critics. Sasha Geffen from the Chicago Reader gave a positive review of the track, complimenting it for bringing the underground PC Music to the mainstream, adding that \"between Diplo's blocky breakdowns and Sophie's slippery arpeggios, [the song i]s a provocative piece of work ... The shift from SoundCloud to superstars was always coming—it just so happens that Madonna is the one who carried it over.\" Another positive review came from Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph, who elaborated: \"[T]he track in question fizzes with bright energy, a handclapping rave anthem powered by a fantastically wonky synth line that sounds like a vintage arcade game played on an electronic kazoo, and topped off with a snappy Nicki Minaj rap. Madonna delivers the melody like a playground nursery rhyme, chanting about bad behavior in a butter-wouldn't-melt sing-song voice.\"\n\nDan Weiss from Spin observed that the \"most surprising thing about a song that's actually called 'Bitch, I'm Madonna' is that it doesn't have any surprises\". In contrast, Andrew Unterberger of the same publication enjoyed the track, claiming that \"it might not be your favorite Madonna, but it's unquestionably her, and it's far more compelling than the anonymous EDM enthusiast she played on MDNA (2012)\". Unterberger also praised the addition of PC Music \"ping-ponging oddball freneticism\" and \"Diplo's block-dropping beats\". Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone was also positive, calling it \"frenetic\", and praised Minaj's verse for being \"pure fire\", while Anna Zelaski of The A.V. Club appreciated the song for being \"the right kind of [track] ... that's mindless fun and impossible to take seriously\". In the same vein, Andy Gill of The Independent called it \"amusingly abrasive\" and praised Minaj for \"repris[ing] her role as Madge's rapping henchgirl\".\n\nIn spite of noting that Diplo makes Madonna sound fun on the song, Gavin Haynes of NME commented that the song's composition \"showed the gulf between [Madonna's] life and her music is now impossible to ignore\". Calling it \"awry\", Alexis Petridis of The Guardian claimed that \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" is \"a fantastic title in search of a song. In lieu of one, producer Diplo comes up with a kind of hybrid of EDM and happy hardcore and throws Nicki Minaj at her most hyperactive into the mix; the result genuinely sets your teeth on edge.\" Criticizing Rebel Heart for being \"overworked\", Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine found that \"the duality of its title [is] muddled by the inclusion of garish party jams like the infuriatingly catchy but lyrically cringe-inducing 'Bitch I'm Madonna. John Murphy of musicOMH remarked that the song \"never quite lives up to its fantastic title, and just sounds a bit of a mess, trying to cram in Diplo-produced dance-hall rhythms, a dubstep breakdown and the seemingly now obligatory Nicki Minaj guest rap\". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters opined that the song—and another Rebel Heart track, \"Illuminati\"—\"absolutely reek of desperation, wanting so badly to shock and offend listeners that they fail to resolve as satisfying songs first and foremost\".\n\nIn their retrospective list of 2015's \"song of the summer\" contenders, Pitchfork stated that \"In an alternate (just) universe, 'Bitch I’m Madonna' became the hit song every summer needs, a celebration that asserts its own right to celebrate.\" In their year end ranking of the best songs from 2015, Entertainment Weekly listed \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" at number 27, saying \"She go hard or she go home, she gon do this all night long—[Madonna]'s standout from Rebel Heart has everything you love about her music: hooks, humor, attitude for days\". In 2018, the same magazine listed it as Madonna's 60th best single. Chuck Arnold called it \"much better than 'Give Me All Your Luvin'' ... this Diplo-produced banger is campy fun that throws a fierce side eye\". Similarly, while ranking the singer's singles in honor of her 60th birthday, Jude Rogers from The Guardian placed the track at number 67, calling it \"energetic, but exhausting\".\n\nCommercial performance \nIn the United States, \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" debuted on Billboards Dance/Electronic Songs chart dated January 3, 2015, at number 14 with sales of 12,000 copies. The song started fluctuating down the chart and exited after four weeks, but following her appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in April 2015, the sales surged by 748% to 9,000 copies, making the song re-enter the chart at number 21. The song again started a downward trajectory on the chart until June 2015, when the music video was released. Sales for that week increased to 13,000 copies, enabling the song to reach a peak of number 5 on the chart, becoming Madonna's second top-ten single there following \"Living for Love\". The song debuted at number 26 on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart and reached a peak of number-one, her record-extending 46th in total; it was also Minaj's fifth number-one. \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart week of July 4, 2015, at number 84, becoming her first entry on the chart since \"Give Me All Your Luvin'\" (2012). The entry was aided by a 1,454% gain in streaming activity for the track, with a total of 2.6 million US streams up to the week ending June 21, 2015. The track became Minaj's 63rd and Madonna's 57th Hot 100 entry, placing them at positions three and four on the list of women with the most entries on the chart. The following week, the song fell down by 11 places on the Hot 100, landing at number 95, which was its final appearance there.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Alan Jones from Music Week reported that following the release of the music video, there was a sales surge for \"Bitch I'm Madonna\", which sold 1,667 copies (up from 148 copies of previous week); however, it was not able to chart within the top 200 positions of the UK Singles Chart. In France, the song debuted at number 90 on the French Singles Chart the week of December 27, 2014, following the advanced release of the album's six tracks for pre-order on iTunes. Later, it fell to number 135, before dropping off the chart. The song re-entered at number 104 when the music video was released, and fell to number 149 the following week. In Spain, the song also debuted with the advanced release, reaching number 49.\n\nMusic video\n\nBackground and development \n\nAlong with announcing \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" as the third single, Madonna also confirmed the release of a music video for the song. She teased in a post on Instagram saying that the video would have many \"surprise\" guests. A number of people were tagged in the Instagram post, including singers Beyoncé, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus, and Rita Ora, as well as Minaj and Diplo. Other personnel tagged included costume designer Arianne Phillips, hair stylist Andy Lecompte and fashion designer Jeremy Scott. Comparisons ensued with the recently released music video for singer-songwriter Taylor Swift's single \"Bad Blood\" which had featured similar guest stars. Madonna had also released images from the set previously, showing her with pink hair and in provocative clothing. Another preview came from the Flaming Lips lead singer Wayne Coyne, who had visited the set and uploaded a short video of the shooting. Filming took place on the top floors of the Standard Hotel in New York City, and was directed by Jonas Åkerlund, who explained how he landed the project as follows:\n\nThe team had a short time for finalizing the different aspects of the shoot, including rehearsing the whole sequence. They also had just one night to complete shooting and due to the casual nature of the song, decided to invite Madonna's close friends and family to be in it. Contrary to normal shooting schedules, the team had to work fast before the sun came up, since they were portraying a party at night. Following the choreography, every person on set had cues about their position and where their part would come in the shooting. A number of designers contributed clothing for the singer to wear, including Moschino, Discount Universe, SSUR, Chanel, Majesty Black and shoes by Giuseppe Zanotti. According to Amber Kallor from Style.com, various contemporary fashion trends appeared in the video, including candy-colored hairs, black lips, white bows and glitter eye makeup.\n\nRelease \nThe video was confirmed to be released on June 16, 2015; Madonna also released a teaser of it, which showed the aftermath of a party, as the song played slowly in the background. On the release day, a poster was uploaded on Madonna's Instagram which confirmed that along with the aforementioned personnel, singer Beyoncé would also appear in it. Joe Lynch from Billboard compared the poster to those uploaded during the release of \"Bad Blood\" but nevertheless believed, \"it's likely that Madge had this project in the works before becoming aware of Taylor's plans\". However, the video did not arrive on June 16, instead a second teaser was released, showing Madonna twerking in jeans shorts and high heels, with multi-colored graphics. It ultimately premiered the next day on Tidal, along with a behind-the-scenes clip. It was an exclusive release to the streaming site for the first 24 hours, following which it was released on Madonna's Vevo page. The full list of guest appearances in the video included Beyoncé, Perry, Cyrus, Minaj, Ora, and Diplo along with rapper Kanye West, actor and comedian Chris Rock, designer Alexander Wang, model Jon Kortajarena and Madonna's sons Rocco and David. However, the video faced problems in Tidal with error messages and freezing in-between, resulting in the company releasing an apology on Twitter: \"We apologize to all the fans excited to watch the #BitchImMadonna video, we’re working on a fix. We'll have it up and running soon.\"\n\nSynopsis \n\nThe video begins with four young girls in outfits inspired by Madonna's iconic \"Like a Virgin\" performance at the 1984 MTV Video Music Awards, who mime the opening lines of the song. Madonna is shown exercising alongside, wearing an animal print dress and a studded, pink motorcycle jacket. She finishes and comes out in a colorful hallway, drinks water, kisses a man and walks through the corridor, crossing Diplo at one point. As the chorus starts the scene cuts to four Japanese dancers (including AyaBambi) making choreographed moves in a bathtub and inside a bar as Madonna joins them. Ora and Rock appears mouthing the phrase \"Bitch I'm Madonna\". The second verse starts with Madonna crawling along the hallway, getting entangled in balloons, meeting Diplo again and finally the camera pans away to reveal a number of sock puppets in neon glow swaying together to the song.\n\nDuring the second chorus, Madonna and her dancers go from the hallway to a bar where the singer forcefully makes Kortajarena drink a beverage, dry humps a dancer and continues dancing. The guest appearances start with Cyrus pointing her middle fingers towards the camera wearing glitter around her eyes, followed by Wang, Diplo and Rocco in the bar, Beyoncé posing like Madonna's music video for \"Vogue\" (1990), Perry moving around to the song, and David dancing while Madonna and the others cheer him; all of them mouth the song name while they appear onscreen. As the chorus ends, a dancer brings a video screen behind them where Minaj appears rapping her part, interspersed by shots of West cheering. Madonna and her dancers continue moving through the room with falling confetti and reach a dance pole. She climbs through a set of dimly lit stairs and reaches the rooftop where the party is taking place. The song nears to an end and Madonna is shown surrounded by her dancers and some partygoers while she lies down; interspersed scenes show her twerking and dancing alone in a room wearing a cap with Hebrew word \"\" (\"Shalom\") written on it. The video ends with a far away shot of the Standard Hotel's brightly lit rooftop where the party continues.\n\nAn alternate ending was present in the behind-the-scenes video, showing an exhausted Madonna leaving the party with a male model, as well as aftermath scenes of the party which were released in the first teaser trailer. The parting shot showed Madonna running around the room and posing in front of the windows overlooking New York. Other scenes included Madonna chatting with Ora and Rock in-between takes, sitting in the hallways, plunging towards the neon sock puppets multiple times as well as singing the song with the little girls from the beginning of the video. Another video set to Kleinenberg's remix featured further footage of Madonna dancing and more casual scenes featuring the guest stars.\n\nReception and analysis \nJason Lipshutz from Billboard wrote an article about why the video was an important release for Madonna. He felt that although the Rebel Heart era had received more promotion than the previous MDNA era, the commercial returns had been diminishing. The first two singles, \"Living for Love\" and \"Ghosttown\", failed to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, making it the first Madonna album without a Hot 100 single, until \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" debuted at number 84. The video, Lipshutz theorized, was Madonna's attempt to bring back an audience for the whole era. Joe Lynch from the same magazine called the video an \"embarrassment of star power\", adding that it \"has everything: Miley's middle fingers, Madonna kissing a shirtless hunk, topless women in a bathtub, break-dancing, sock puppets singing, Moschino fashion and much more\". Brennan Carly from Spin believed that the \"grandeur and ambition\" of the clip made it comparable to Madonna's music videos for \"Hung Up\" (2005) and \"Living for Love\".\n\nKevin O'Donnell from Entertainment Weekly said that although \"[a]nytime Madonna announces a new video, it's a global event. And it's no different with ['Bitch I'm Madonna']\", he called it \"her most bonkers video in years\". Hicks from the San Jose Mercury News was impressed with the video, but felt Madonna could have done it without the guest appearances. Emilee Linder from MTV News observed that the video was completely different from the one released by Swift, but described it as \"action-packed\" in a different way, that of portraying a party. Daniel Kreps from Rolling Stone declared that, with the release of \"Bitch I'm Madonna\", \"the age of blockbuster all-star music videos are upon us\". Both Nolan Feeney from Time and August Brown from the Los Angeles Times noted that Madonna was able to successfully bring together her music industry peers in one video.\n\nChristopher Rosa from VH1 criticized the fact that none of the female singers apart from Rita Ora were actually present on set during shooting of the video; their parts were filmed separately. He added that it was \"pretty hilarious. Madge's clip is called, 'Bitch I'm Madonna', but why couldn't she get these youths to show the eff up?\" Writing for Life & Style magazine, Chantal Waldholtz was disappointed with the clip, calling it \"lackluster\" due to the short cameo appearances. Kevin Fallon from The Daily Beast called the video \"pathetic and sad\" and questioned the inclusion of guest stars like Swift's video, ultimately describing the whole affair as \"absolutely pointless. At worst, it's desperate. At best, it's just dumb ... [The video] is a fascinating mix of impressive and sad, both aggressively relevant and therefore wholly irrelevant at the same time.\" He ended the review with one compliment about the single take in which the video was shot, comparing it to the 2014 black comedy film Birdman.\n\nBernard Zuel from The Sydney Morning Herald spoke about the problems with the release to Tidal, saying \"Apologies, embarrassment and another social media fail: is this already a new low water mark for Madonna and Tidal only weeks after it began operating?\" He criticized Madonna's team for not being able to release the video smoothly, while also noting that negative feedback given to the video included \"Madonna's age, sexually charged performances, [and] need to shock\". Tshepo Mokoena from The Guardian considered the cameos as more of \"slapdash than slick\", appearing as \"flat and glossily detached\". Time magazine listed the music video at number 8 on their ranking of the \"Top 10 Pop Music Videos of 2015\", describing it as \"nuts as its croaking bass drop\".\n\nLive performances \n\nMadonna performed \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" during her appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on April 9, 2015. She adorned herself in a black jacket covered with gold dollar symbols and a number of gold chains around her neck. The performance began with Madonna in the backstage where she put finishing touches to her make-up, then entered Diplo's dressing room where he was having a party surrounded by women. Madonna did a dance routine in the hallway where her son Rocco appeared mouthing the chorus. The singer and her troupe then moved into the studio area where the audience was present. Energetic dancing continued with Madonna straddling one member of the audience at one point. Still photos of Minaj were projected on video screens with Diplo DJing on a console. Madonna also climbed atop Fallon's desk and made him sing the chorus line. The performance ended with another energetic dance routine and crumping.\n\nBiance Gracie from Idolator gave a positive review to the performance, saying that \"Instead of doing her usual bit of either singing 'Living for Love' or the current single 'Ghosttown', the entertainer decided to switch things up a bit—and we're so glad [she] did! Madge did a wild and super-fun version of 'Bitch I'm Madonna'.\" The Hollywood Reporter listed the performance as one of the top five shocking moments by Madonna in 2015. Stereogums Caitlin White was amazed by Madonna's performance, saying that \"the fact that she can dance like ... this at 56 is practically a superhuman feat, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the performance.\" Bradley Stern also wrote a similar review for MuuMuse, describing the performance as \"one of the most all-out insane television performances of the entire Rebel Heart era ... This was no basic stage performance: Instead, Madonna brought her noisy, bratty and utterly #Unapologetic banger to life.\"\n\nOn the Rebel Heart Tour (2015–16), the song was the second performance on the set list, during the first segment. For the first section, inspired by the Rebel Heart album cover art and Joan of Arc, costume designer Arianne Phillips had created a series of costumes referencing liturgical fabrics and a contemporary exhibition of samurai armor at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. As the theatrical performance of opening number \"Iconic\" concluded, Madonna was joined onstage by her female dancers wearing geisha-inspired costumes. They started performing the song while holding Japanese war fans. Minaj appeared on the backdrops rapping her verses, aided by \"shuddering\" bass sounds. The performance of the song at the March 19–20, 2016 shows in Sydney's Allphones Arena was recorded and released in Madonna's fifth live album, Rebel Heart Tour. On December 6, 2016, Madonna performed the song during the Carpool Karaoke segment of The Late Late Show with James Corden.\n\nA medley of \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" and \"Celebration\" (2009) is the closing number of the Celebration Tour (2023–24). It found the singer surrounded by dancers dressed like her throughout time, included a tribute to Michael Jackson and photos of \"fairly random dead icons, crowing 'Bitch I’m Madonna' over and over\". The performance ended with Madonna and the dancers hugging each other. Kate Solomon from British news paper i pointed out that, \"the energy was so intense it felt like a riot could break out at any second\".\n\nTrack listing \nDigital download / streaming\n \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" (featuring Nicki Minaj) – 3:47\n\nDigital download / streaming – Clean version\n \"B**** I'm Madonna\" (featuring Nicki Minaj) – 3:47\n\nDigital download / streaming – Remixes\n \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" (Fedde le Grand remix) – 3:55\n \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" (Rosabel's Bitch Move mix) – 7:05\n \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" (Sander Kleinenberg remix) – 4:58\n \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" (Junior Sanchez remix) – 5:10\n \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" (Oscar G 305 dub) – 8:44\n \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" (Sick Individuals remix) – 5:07\n \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" (Dirty Pop remix) – 5:11\n \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" (Flechette remix) – 3:21\n \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" (Oscar G Bitch Beats) – 8:44\n \"Bitch I'm Madonna\" (Rosabel's Bitch Move dub) – 7:35\n\nCredits and personnel \nPersonnel adapted from Madonna's official website.\n\nManagement \nWebo Girl Publishing, Inc.

        "Crottin de Chavignol is a goat cheese produced in the Loire Valley. This cheese is the claim to fame for the village of Chavignol, France, which has only two hundred inhabitants.\n\nHistory\nThe small cylindrical goat cheese from the area around Chavignol has been produced since the 16th century, but the earliest extant written record dates from 1829 when its name and brief details of the cheese were recorded by a tax inspector.\n\nThe etymology is dubious: the word crot described a small oil lamp made from burned clay, which resembles the mould used to prepare the cheese. Another explanation is that old Crottin gets harder and browner and tends to look like dung, the French word for an animal dropping being crotte.\n\nQuality control\nProtected by the AOC Seal, Crottin de Chavignol is produced today with traditional methods. If a cheese is labelled \"Crottin de Chavignol\", it has to be from the area around Chavignol, and it has to meet the stringent AOC production criteria.\n\nFlavour and age\n\nCrottin de Chavignol is subtle and slightly nutty. In its youth (Chavignol jeune), its dough is solid and compact, and its rind is white. As it ripens (Chavignol bleuté), it takes on a stronger flavour and develops a harder rind. With full maturity (Chavignol affiné), the dough becomes crumbly and the mould on the rind matures into a bluish colour. The cheese is marketed and eaten at all three stages of maturity.\n\nRecipes\nA classic dish is baked Crottin de Chavignol on a green salad. The dish is said to go well with a Sancerre wine from its home region. Although commonly served as a baked starter, Chavignol is also often found cold as a component element of a cheese board selection.\n\nSee also\n List of goat milk cheeses\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nFrench cheeses\nFrench products with protected designation of origin\nGoat's-milk cheeses\nCheeses with designation of origin protected in the European Union",

        "John Chadburn (12 February 1873 – December 1923) was an English footballer who played in the Football League for Lincoln City, Notts County, Wolverhampton Wanderers, West Bromwich Albion and Liverpool. He also played in the Southern League for Plymouth Argyle. Born in Mansfield, Chadburn could play as a full back and an outside forward.\n\nCareer\nChadburn joined English Football League side Lincoln City in 1892. He made his first team debut on 7 September 1893 in a 1–1 draw against Rotherham Town. He scored 10 times during the season in 27 appearances in total. This earned him a move to First Division Notts County where he remained for three seasons.\n\nHe joined Wolverhampton Wanderers in October 1897, making his club debut on 27 November 1897 in a 2–1 win at Preston North End. Chadburn was unable to hold down a regular first team place at Molineux, and made just 12 appearances in total over two seasons.\n\nHe moved to their Black Country rivals West Bromwich Albion in January 1900. Here, he helped the club win promotion as champions back to the top flight in the 1901–02 campaign.\n\nLiverpool signed him during the summer of 1903 but he only managed two first team appearances for the Merseyside club, the opening fixtures of the 1903–04 season. He joined Southern League side Plymouth Argyle towards the end of the campaign, their first as a professional club, and made his debut in March 1904. He appeared sporadically for the first team, scoring one goal in 15 appearances, before being released at the end of the 1904–05 season. He had a brief spell with Swindon Town and went on to play for Mansfield Mechanics and Woodhouse Rangers before retiring from competitive football in 1909.\n\nReferences\n\n1873 births\n1923 deaths\nFootballers from Mansfield\nEnglish Football League players\nLincoln City F.C. players\nNotts County F.C. players\nWolverhampton Wanderers F.C. players\nWest Bromwich Albion F.C. players\nLiverpool F.C. players\nBarnsley F.C. players\nMansfield Mechanics F.C. players\nMansfield Town F.C. players\nReading F.C. players\nSouthern Football League players\nPlymouth Argyle F.C. players\nSwindon Town F.C. players\nWestern Football League players\nMen's association football outside forwards\nMen's association football fullbacks\nEnglish men's footballers",

        "Kauvadol is the name of a hill about 4 Kilometers south-west from the Barabar Hills and about 12 Kilometers east from Bela Railway Station. The name literally means \"crows swing,\" which, it is said, is derived from the fact that a huge block of stone was once lying so well balanced on the existing pinnacle of the hill that it used to rock when a crow alighted on it. Below the hill are the ruins of an ancient Vihara that surround the area. The site was first noticed by Buchanan during his tour of observations for the East India Company in the year 1811–12. Later, Major Kittoe, Cunningham and Beglar also visited the site and noted the ruins of the Vihara.\n\nReferences\n\nVillages in Gaya district",

        "Christina Schlesinger (born November 19, 1946) is an American painter and muralist. Daughter of historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., she sought independence from her family's fame, practiced “protest art”, and came out as a lesbian. She made strong rapport with the Chicano community in Venice, California, where she founded the multi-cultural art center SPARC.\n\nLife and career \nSchlesinger is the daughter of the famous historian, Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. and artist Marian Cannon Schlesinger. Schlesinger grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She had two brothers, Stephen and Andrew, a half-brother, Robert and a  sister, Katharine who died in 2004 of ovarian cancer. She was the middle child. Schlesinger's mother was an accomplished artist in her own right.\n\nSchlesinger always considered herself a tomboy and recalls that she and her mother argued about her wearing dresses. Instead, she wanted to do things which were considered traditionally male at the time.\n\nSchlesinger attended Radcliffe College and was an English and Fine Arts major, graduating cum laude in 1968. She attended the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture during the summer of 1968. After Schlesinger finished school, she started to create \"protest art.\" Her mother and father were divorced in 1970. The divorce created a desire in Schlesinger to \"get away\" and she had her own things to say.\n\nIn 1971, Schlesinger moved to Los Angeles. Schlesinger came out as a lesbian in Venice, California and found the Chicano community to be supportive of her. Schlesinger met artist, Judy Baca, at a lesbian bar, Big Bothers, in Venice where Baca was recruiting artists to paint The History of Venicemurals. The two artists then collaborated on that mural. In 1976, she and Baca and filmmaker Donna Deitch, co-founded SPARC. Schlesinger was instrumental in coming up with the name of the center. Schlesinger remains proud of her part in SPARC and its commitment to public art that uncovers hidden parts of history and lends a political and social consciousness to art. She was also part of the team of artists who helped design The Great Wall of Los Angeles.\n\nSchlesinger moved back to New York in the 1980s, where she quickly started showing her work. In the early 1990s, Schlesinger became part of the Guerrilla Girls. Each artist in the Guerrilla Girls chooses to remain anonymous and go by an artist's name. Schlesinger chose the name Romaine Brooks.\n\nSchlesinger received an MFA from Rutgers in 1994.\n\nSchlesinger was a cultural history and art teacher at the Ross School, where she worked from 1996 until 2005. During this time, she adopted and her partner, sculptor Nancy Fried, adopted their daughter, Chun from China.\n\nIn 2001, she moved to East Hampton and later built a studio there.\n\nIn 2008, Schlesinger was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The treatment and complications from the cancer kept her from painting for two years. After her recovery, Schlesinger continued to work, teach and show her art in different venues.\n\nArt \nIn the 1990s Schlesinger created \"explicitly erotic work.\" During the 1990s, it was very taboo for lesbians to bring up issues of sexualty, and many felt as if they were \"forced into hiding.\" Schlesinger boldly depicted lesbians (including portraits of herself) wearing dildos and penetrating other women. Schlesinger was interested in \"representing female masculinity\" and \"refuting the notion that the artist's erotic gaze is exclusively male.\" Her work was also very much about embracing and celebrating her sexuality. These paintings and etchings of a very erotic nature were considered gutsy and ground-breaking, and many of them were not shown again until 2014.\n\nChagall Comes to Venice Beach (1991) is a large mural, 138 by 18 feet long, painted on the Israel Levin Senior Adult Center in Venice, California. The mural celebrates the Jewish community of Los Angeles. In 1994, the mural was destroyed in the Northridge earthquake. Schlesinger returned to Los Angeles in 1996 to repaint the mural now called Chagall Returns to Venice Beach. In 2016, the mural was land marked by the city of Los Angeles. In 2018 the building was renovated and the mural was destroyed a second time. In 2021, the Jewish Federation re-commissioned Schlesinger to paint a 15 by 9 foot interior mural, printed on metal and visible to the public from the boardwalk through a bank of windows.\n\nSchlesinger's landscapes paintings include her birch trees series which use images of nature as a stand-in for love and eroticism. The Long Good-Bye depicts two trees in the moonlight.\n\nSchlesinger's current work embraces her love of mural painting and nature. It consists of large scale ink paintings of trees and waterfalls on bed sheets, influenced by both the scale of mural painting as well as earlier brush painting techniques she learned in China.\n\nSome of her artistic influences include Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Giotto, photographer BrassaÏ, Miriam Schapiro, and Sigmar Polke.\n\nQuotes \n\"The tomboy is the lesbian's inner core, her secret weapon.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Christina Schlesinger Official Site\n Christina Schlesinger (video)\n\n1946 births\nLiving people\n20th-century American painters\n21st-century American painters\n20th-century American women artists\n21st-century American women artists\nAmerican muralists\nAmerican people of Austrian descent\nAmerican people of English descent\nAmerican people of German-Jewish descent\nAmerican women painters\nArtists from Cambridge, Massachusetts\nPainters from Massachusetts\nRadcliffe College alumni\nAmerican women muralists\n21st-century American LGBT people\nAmerican lesbian artists",

        "Andrew David Coster (born ) is the current New Zealand Police Commissioner and former Deputy Police Commissioner. He has served as the New Zealand Commissioner of Police since 3 April 2020.\n\nEarly life\nCoster was born in 1975 or 1976 in Dunedin, and grew up in Auckland. His father is Professor Gregor Coster, the former Dean of the Wellington Faculty of Health.\n\nCoster holds a Bachelor of Laws (Honours) from the University of Auckland and a Master of Public Management from Victoria University of Wellington.\n\nCareer \nCoster joined the New Zealand Police in 1997 and has worked in both frontline and investigative roles. As his career progressed he was appointed to a number of senior roles, including Auckland City Area Commander, South District Commander. Prior to his appointment as Commissioner, Coster was the acting Deputy Commissioner: Strategy & Partnerships. While in this role he oversaw the development of firearms reforms introduced by the Government following the March 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings. \n\nIn 2004 Coster graduated with a Bachelor of Laws with Honours from the University of Auckland, and worked as a Crown prosecutor for Meredith Connell for less than a year.\n\nCoster has also spent time at the Ministry of Justice, having been seconded on a two-year term from 2016 to 2018 as the Deputy Chief Executive for the Ministry.\n\nPolice Commissioner\nCoster was appointed as the Commissioner of the New Zealand Police on 9 March 2020. Another candidate as Commissioner was Mike Clement, the then-Deputy Commissioner. He started his term on 3 April 2020 at age 44, becoming the youngest person to assume the role.\n\nIn mid-February 2021, Coster's efforts to combat gang and gun violence was criticised by the National Party's Justice spokesperson Simon Bridges, who described Coster as a \"wokester commissioner\" in a Twitter post. On 25 February, Coster defended the Police's \"policing by consent\" policies in response to criticism by Bridges during a Justice select committee hearing at the New Zealand Parliament.\n\nDuring the 2022 Wellington protests, Coster unsuccessfully attempted to convince anti-vaccine mandate protesters to voluntarily remove their illegally parked vehicles from the area around the New Zealand Parliament in mid February 2022. After protesters refused to vacate the Parliament grounds, he ruled out pursuing enforcement action against protesters due to concerns about violence. Coster instead announced that Police would pursue a policy of \"negotiation and de-escalation.\" Coster's decision to rule out \"enforcement action\" was criticised by the National Party's police spokesman Mark Mitchell, who claimed that Coster had lost credibility as Police Commissioner. On 2 March, Police evicted the remaining anti-mandate protesters following a violent riot.\n\nRanks and postings\n 1996–1997: Police Recruit, Constable\n 1997–2003: Various different frontline and investigative roles within Counties Manukau and Auckland Metro area\n 2005–2006: Response Manager/Section Supervisor, Counties Manukau West\n 2006–2008: District Deployment Manager, Counties Manukau\n 2009–2013: Area Commander, Auckland City Central\n 2011–2013: Armed Offenders Squad Commander, Auckland\n 2013–2015: District Commander, Southern Police District\n 2015–2016: Assistant Commissioner, Strategy and Transformation\n 2018: Deputy Commissioner, Resource Management (acting)\n 2018–2020: Deputy Commissioner, Strategy and Partnerships (acting)\n 2020–present: Commissioner of Police\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n1970s births\nLiving people\n20th-century New Zealand public servants\n21st-century New Zealand public servants\nPeople from Dunedin\nNew Zealand Commissioners of Police",

        "Cyril Duval (born December 31, 1977), who works under the name Item Idem, is a French conceptual artist, designer, and filmmaker. He lives and works in Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nBiography \n\nDuval was born in Paris, France, in 1977. His mother worked for the luxury goods manufacturer Hermès, while his father was an interior decorator. Duval studied for six years at the École nationale supérieure d'arts de Paris-Cergy, before moving to Tokyo in 2004.\n\nCareer \n\nDuval's work encompasses conceptual art, film, sculpture, product design, and visual communication. His alter ego Item Idem (Latin for \"the same\"), operates as a brand for the artist, whose work often builds on top of existing fashion and retail brands. The New York Times reviewed one of Duval's performances as \"Celine Dion at the Oscars channeling René Magritte,\" while the writer John Stones has described the artist's persona as \"Austin Powers pretending to be Philippe Starck, art directed by Marcel Duchamp and scripted by Oscar Wilde.\"\n\nRetail design and installations \n\nIn 2004, Duval was discovered by Sarah Andelman, the creative director of Colette. The Paris-based boutique teamed Duval up with the Japanese fashion label Comme des Garçons in Tokyo. His work began to incorporate interior design and conceptual installations. In 2004, Duval collaborated with other artists on a relational aesthetics-inspired, multidisciplinary space called Caniche Courage, and later transformed his three-story Shibuya residence into a living exhibition.\n\nDuval initiated a series of staged retail and working environments, beginning with The Wrong Store (2006) in Paris, a collaboration with Tobi Wong conceived as an ersatz gift-shop counterpart to Maurizio Cattelan's Wrong Gallery. Back in Tokyo, he transformed the window display of a fashion boutique into a temporary work space titled The Wrong Office, which he followed up with The Wrong Motel.\n\nDuval collaborated with Bernhard Willhelm on the German fashion designer's flagship store at the PARCO department store in Shibuya, Tokyo. The shop's re-use of cardboard, plastic, and rope materials was inspired by the resourcefulness of Japan's homeless communities.\nThe store won the Best Shop Concept for FRAME magazine's 2007 Great Indoors Award.\n\nIn 2009, Duval participated in the Cycles and Seasons fashion and art event in Moscow. In 2011, Duval was the first artist-in-residence at BLESS HOME, an apartment-cum-shop in Berlin, which became his temporary studio while serving as the art director for Bruce LaBruce's production of Pierrot Lunaire. In 2015, he built an installation as an interior for Airbnb's Art House for Art Basel Hong Kong.\n\nDuval has worked with a number of art publications, including as the Fashion Director for Tokion (2005), Fashion Features Director for Modern Weekly China (2013), Special Projects coordinator for Flash Art (2006),\nand as a collaborator with 032c, T: The New York Times Style Magazine, and LEAP Magazine. He has also worked on large-scale commercial projects for CELINE and Ford.\n\nExhibitions and collaborations \n\nIn 2007, Duval reconfigured CELINE's Tokyo store to host his exhibition Displaysthetics during DesignTide Tokyo. In 2008, he participated in Fredric Snitzer Gallery's show in Miami, Death by Basel, with an oversized Chanel logo in the style of McDonald's Golden Arches, as a comparison of the brands and their markets. For AA Bronson's School for Young Shaman's exhibition in New York, Duval fashioned a cape out of Louis Vuitton bags and melted car tires, which was an homage to Joseph Beuys.\n\nFor the exhibition Dysfashional at the Garage Museum in Moscow in 2010, Duval created a work titled Mount Blushmore, a crystal engraving which combined images of fashion icons Anna Wintour, Donatella Versace, John Galliano and Karl Lagerfeld. In 2014, Duval mounted his first solo exhibition at Johannes Vogt, New York, titled Voir Dire.\n\nIn 2016, Duval participated in the Work in Progress artist residency in Times Square, New York. That same year, he held an exhibition titled Method of Loci at The Breeder Gallery in Athens, Greece, and collaborated with Flash Art Special Projects in a special presentation at Paramount Ranch.\n\nDuval has exhibited at the Centre Pompidou, the Garage Museum, MoMA PS1, and Palais de Tokyo. His work has been featured in 032c, Casa BRUTUS, FRAME, The New York Times, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Harper’s Bazaar Korea, and WWD.\n\nShanzhai Biennial \n\nDuval is the co-founder of the artists collective Shanzhai Biennial with stylist Avena Gallagher and artist Babak Radboy. The collective describes itself as a \"multinational brand posing as an art-project posing as an [sic] multinational brand posing as a biennial\", \"a pure brand unencumbered by products\", in other words a \"meta-brand\". The name is meant to evoke a bi-annual art exhibition, but instead of taking a city as its namesake, it refers to the Shanzhai counterfeit consumer goods industry in China, and the intentionally incorrect appropriation of luxury brand names. Inspired by knockoff goods in Manhattan's Chinatown, the collective was initiated as a critique of the art and fashion industries, as well as a celebration of the ingenuity and humour of Shanzhai culture. The collective undertakes projects by invitation from cultural institutions or brands, and highlights the aspect of Shanzhai that M+ curator Aric Chen has called the \"pop art of China\".\n\nAs a precursor to the collective's projects, Duval curated a selection of Shanzhai objects in collaboration with DIS Magazine. The objects were photographed by Marco Roso for an exhibition titled Shanzhai Anxiety at Colette in 2011.\n\nShanzhai Biennial No. 1 was held during Beijing Design Week 2012. The artists created a fake fashion campaign photo-shoot based on the paintings of Chinese artist Yue Minjun, and installed a false store-front in Beijing's Chaochangdi village, complete with red carpet, rope lines, and a step and repeat press wall. The ad campaign also ran as an eight-page editorial in the Chinese lifestyle magazine Modern Weekly. When the New York Times mistook the project for \"a high-concept fashion line\" that hadn't yet produced a collection, the artists decided not to issue a correction.\n\nShanzhai Biennial No. 2 consisted of a video depicting the artist Wu Ting Ting dressed as a shampoo bottle and lip-syncing to a Chinese rendition of Sinéad O'Connor’s Nothing Compares 2 U, and was displayed on an LED curtain for MoMA PS1's ProBio exhibition in 2013.\n\nThe artists followed this up with Shanzhai Biennial No. 3 at Frieze London 2014, conceived as a branding exercise for the art fair. Working with a local luxury real-estate agency, the artists transformed a booth space into a model real-estate office ostensibly selling a £32 million London mansion, complete with a professional ad campaign, and trafficking in the Frieze brand with a fake luxury bag, and limited edition souvenirs.\n\nShanzhai Biennial has collaborated with the designer Telfar Clemens, the musician Fatima Al Qadiri, as well as TankTV and DIS Magazine, and has exhibited work at West Bund Art & Design, Centre Pompidou, and the New Museum.\n\nFilms \n\nIn 2013, Duval created the short film Joss with Chinese artist Cheng Ran, depicting paper funeral items resembling fashion accessories and commercial brands being destroyed by flames and fire crackers. The film has been screened at Palais de Tokyo (Paris), K11 Art Foundation Pop-up Space (Hong Kong), and Museum of Contemporary Art Taipei.\n\nDuval's short film NUII premièred at the Bethlehem Baptist Church in Los Angeles in 2017. The film features corporate and political symbols being burnt in effigy. His experimental short film COLD SINGLE was filmed in Taitung, Taiwan, with Taiwanese director Mel Hsieh, inspired by his life in the country. The film was presented for the first time at ASIA NOW at the Paris Asian Art Fair in 2019, with its US première set for Frieze Los Angeles 2020 at the Paramount Theatre.\n\nReferences\n\nLiving people\nArtists from Paris\nFrench conceptual artists\nFrench designers\n1977 births",

        "Dominko \"Dinko\" Zlatarić (1558–1613) was a Croatian poet and translator from Republic of Ragusa, considered the best translator of the Renaissance.\n\nLife\nDominiko was the most famous member of the Zlatarić noble family from Dubrovnik.  Dinko was born in 1558 as the son of Žimun (Simone Slatarich) Zlatarić and Frana, daughter of a very wealthy nobleman by the name of Dominik Kladurobović. Dinko's brother Mihajlo Zlatarić served as a major-lieutenant in the forces of Juraj IV Zrinski, while history didn't remember his other brothers Cvijeto and Nikola. His only sister Kata died by 1597. Dominiko had one son the name Žimun Zlatarić.\n\nLearning Italian and Latin from a young age and writing his first poems when still a child, Dinko showed his talent early. Because of that, his father sent him to Padua, where after completing the famous Gymnasium, he entered the local University, where he learned rhetoric, philosophy and civil law. In 1579 he funded the printing of Italian poems of his close friend Caesar Simonetti and dedicated them to Cvijeta Zuzorić. He also studied Greek in Padua.\n\nBecause of his knowledge and seriousness, the students elected him rector on 13 August 1579. For keeping the peace and order at the university, he was rewarded by the Republic of Venice with the title of \"Golden Knight\" (). In 1580, a plaque was put at the university in his honor and he returned to his home Dubrovnik.\n\nIn 1587 he married Mara, the daughter of Pero Gomović. He shared his time between writing and running his estates in Cavtat and Konavle. He had friends among poets from Italy and Dubrovnik and admired the famous Renaissance beauty Cvijeta Zuzorić. Zlatarić wrote in Croatian and Italian – love poems, epitaphs and poetic meditations – but his greatest achievements are his translations.\n\nHe held an important place in the historiography of Croatian literature, as he explicitly declared the language of his works under its Croatian name, \"iz veće tuđijeh jezika u hrvacki izložene\".\n\nTranslations and poems\nHe translated Tasso's manuscript of the pastoral drama Aminta in Padua in 1580. Later, dissatisfied with his translation, Zlatarić changed it, reworked it and adapted it to a Croatian setting, so it became Ljubmir. Then he published Electra, a Tragedy, and Ljubmir, a Pastoral History (a collection of his translations) and Love and Death of Pyramus and Thisbe, Translated into Croatian from Several Foreign Languages, in Venice in 1597. Zlatarić dedicated Electra to Juraj Zrinski, Ljubmir to Miho Matufić, and Pyramus and Thisbe to Cvijeta Zuzorić.\n\nHis translations from Greek, Italian and Latin included 26 original pjesni u smrt od razlicijeh (poems about various people's deaths). After his death, his son Miho Zlatarić collected and published 137 lyrical poems of his father under the title Pjesni razlike (Various Poems). Most of them are love poems.\n\nZlatarić was one of the most prolific epitaph writers of the Croatian Renaissance. The most effective one is his short epitaph to Dinko Ranjina (Nadgrobje Dinku Ranjini), followed by the epitaph to Bartolomeo Pescionio, the husband of Cvijeta Zuzorić. Zlatarić's poems are included in the Zadar Collection.\n\nAnalysis\nHe wrote under the influence of the first generation of Croatian Petrarchists and Italian Petrarchist schools. His strong links with the local Petrarchist tradition are shown by his rich style. His varied expression, mastery of verse and sound, put Zlatarić among the best Croatian lyrical poets of his time.\n\nZlatarić is also renowned as the best translator of the Croatian Renaissance. He translated Tasso's Aminta literally, with the necessary changes forced by a different meter. The second version, Ljubmir, is even more refined, literary and pure, with a richer language. His translation of Sophocles' Electra reveals not only Zlatarić's education, taste and versifying ability, but also his poetic gift. Love of Pyramus and Thisbe is closer to a prose translation. In general, Zlatarić's translations can be considered independent poetic achievements, widening the range of Croatian Renaissance literature.\n\nWorks\nAminta, Padua, 1580\nElektra, trađeija, Ljubmir, pripovijes pastijerska (Electra, a Tragedy, and Ljubmir, a Pastoral History), Venice, 1597\nLjubav i smrt Pirama i Tizbe, iz veće tuđijeh jezika u hrvacki složene (Love and Death of Pyramus and Thisbe, Translated into Croatian from Several Foreign Languages), Venice, 1597\nPjesni razlike (Various Poems), posthumous\n\nSee also\n\n Republic of Ragusa\n Dubrovnik\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n Zlatarić – renowned Croatian poet of the second half of the sixteenth century\n Zlatarić – poet and translator\n\n1558 births\n1613 deaths\n16th-century Croatian poets\n16th-century male writers\nCroatian translators\nPeople from the Republic of Ragusa\nRagusan poets\nCroatian male poets\nPeople from Dubrovnik\nUniversity of Padua alumni",

        "The Negros scops owl (Otus nigrorum), also known as the Visayan scops owl, is an owl, endemic to the islands of Negros and Panay in the Philippines, belonging to the family of the typical owls Strigidae. It was formerly classified as a subspecies of the Philippine scops owl. It is threatened by habitat loss and hunting for the pet trade.\n\nDescription \nEBird describes the bird as \"A fairly small owl of lowland and foothill forest on the islands of Negros and Panay, where it is the only scops-owl. Dark brown above and pale gray below, with a rufous face bordered with a black line and a pale gray V-shape between the eyes. Occurs together with Luzon boobook, but Negros Scops-Owl has orange rather than yellow eyes and lacks the brown-streaked chest. Song is a descending series of upslurred yelps.\"\n\nIt is the smallest and palest of the endemic Philippine scops owl complex.\n\nNegros scops owls prey at night on insects. They live alone or in monogamous pairs. They breed throughout the year, laying clutches of 1 or 2 eggs.  They nest in tree hollows in forests of the Philippine lowlands.\n\nHabitat and conservation status \nIts natural habitats are tropical moist lowland and montane primary and secondary forest up to 1,000 meters above sea level. While they can tolerate secondary forest, they have the highest population densities and health in primary (old-growth) forest.\n\nThe IUCN Red List has assessed this bird as vulnerable with the population being estimated at 1,000 to 2,499 mature individuals. Its main threat is habitat destruction through both legal and Illegal logging, conversion into farmlands through slash-and-burn, charcoal burning, and mining. Habitat loss on both Negros and Panay has been extensive. By 2007, Negros and Panay had a 3% and 6% remaining forest cover with a huge chunk of this being in higher elevation forests where this bird does not thrive. Despite the already paltry numbers, these figures are still continuing to decline due to the above-mentioned threats.\n\nThere are currently no species-specific conservation plans. It occurs in a few protected areas in Northern Negros Natural Park, Mount Kanlaon National Park and Northwest Panay Peninsula Natural Park. However, as with most areas in the Philippines, protection from hunting and illegal logging is lax.\n\nReferences\n\nDickinson, E.C., R.S. Kennedy, and K.C. Parkes. 1991.

        "The Liberty Street Historic District is a historic district located in the Dolores Heights neighborhood of San Francisco, California, U.S.. It is a residential area spanning two blocks on Liberty Street and is part of the Liberty Hill Historic District, a city designated landmark district. The J Church Muni light rail crosses the district at the Right Of Way/Liberty station. Liberty Street Historic District is listed as a California Historical Landmark since September 15, 1983; and on the National Register of Historic Places on September 15, 1983, for architecture.\n\nLocation \n\nThe Liberty Street Historic District, as defined by the National Register of Historic Places, is a residential enclave comprising 51 detached residential buildings along both sides of nearly two city blocks. It should be noted the \"Liberty Hill Historic District\" (a similar name) has been listed as a San Francisco Designated Landmark since 1972, however it comprises a larger area and contains the Liberty Street Historic District; with 298 residential buildings within a 10 city block area as defined by the city.\n\nAbout \nThe land for the site slopes up steeply, it is located immediately west of San Francisco's Mission District flatlands, and a stream is said to run down the line of the street in a brick culvert. All of the contributing buildings to the historic district are narrow residential structures, are generally two stories tall, and most buildings have corniced false fronts masking gable roofs.\n\nThe Liberty Street Historic District is significant as a quiet residential enclave containing a capsule history of middle-class urban housing over a 45-year period. One third of houses are Italianate-style built in the 1860s and 1870s. Other architecture styles found in the Liberty Street Historic District include seven Stick style (and Stick-Eastlake style) houses built in the 1880s, six Queen Anne style houses built in the 1890s, and five duplex buildings in local vernacular versions of Classical revival built in the early 20th-century.\n\nSee also \n\n California Historical Landmarks in San Francisco County, California\n National Register of Historic Places listings in San Francisco\n\nReferences \n\nDolores Heights, San Francisco\nNational Register of Historic Places in San Francisco\nHistoric districts on the National Register of Historic Places in California\nCalifornia Historical Landmarks\nItalianate architecture in California",

        "Francisca Louisa Zecha (1848–1939), usually known as Louisa Zecha, was a prominent, colonial Indonesian community leader and the Indo-Bohemian matriarch of the Lauw-Sim-Zecha family, part of the 'Cabang Atas' gentry of the Dutch East Indies (today Indonesia). She attracted significant attention due to her controversial interracial marriages to two Peranakan Chinese magnates, Lauw Tek Lok, Luitenant der Chinezen of Bekasi and Sim Keng Koen, Kapitein der Chinezen of Sukabumi. The posts of Kapitein and Luitenant der Chinezen were high-ranking civil administration positions in the Dutch colonial bureaucracy. Zecha's community leadership, philanthropy, personal bravery and longevity earned her widespread respect and admiration in colonial society by the time she died in 1939.\n\nBiography\nBorn in 1848 in Batavia, Java, Francisca Louisa Zecha was the daughter of a Bohemian engraver and adventurer, Josef Zecha. Her first husband, Lauw Tek Lok, was a prominent and wealthy landlord who served as the Luitenant der Chinezen of Bekasi for 28 years from 1854 until his death in 1882. The couple had five children: Christian Tjeng Soey Lauw-Zecha, Maximiliaan Theodoor Tjeng Kiet Lauw-Zecha, Louis Tjeng Bie Lauw-Zecha, Emilia Joe Nio Lauw-Zecha and Cornelia Sebastiana Gobang Nio Lauw-Zecha.\n\nAfter her first husband's death, Zecha married his former private secretary, Sim Keng Koen, who – after his secretarial employment – had carved out a successful bureaucratic career, having been appointed Luitenant der Chinezen of the Kong Koan (Chinese Council) of Batavia in 1880. They had four children: Sim Tjeng Bouw, Betsy Lembor Nio Sim-Zecha, Piet Tjeng Ho Sim-Zecha and Chester Tjeng Soan Lauw-Sim-Zecha. Zecha's second husband was promoted to the rank of Kapitein in 1887, and kept his post until 1889.\n\nIn 1892, with the couple having settled in Sukabumi, West Java, the former Kapitein Sim Keng Koen was appointed the first Hoofd der Chinezen of Sukabumi with the rank of Kapitein-titulair der Chinezen. According to the sociologist Mely G. Tan, the Lauw-Sim-Zecha family lived as Sukabumi's premier Chinese family; Tan attributes a great part of the Kapitein's high profile and influence to Zecha's personality.\n\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, in the face of a violent uprising in Tamboen and in the absence of any Dutch military response, Zecha showed great personal courage. Accompanied by her husband, she rode on horseback to meet directly with the insurgents, whom she addressed in person and talked into surrendering. Zecha subsequently rode on her own to Meester Cornelis to notify the authorities of the surrender, and that no military action was needed.\n\nShe was well known for her philanthropy. In 1916, she initiated the installation of a statue of the god Kongco Han Tan Kong at Sukabumi's main Chinese temple, Wihara Widhi Sakti, in order to provide a moral inspiration to the town's Chinese community during an ongoing and persistent cholera epidemic. She also spearheaded more practical measures to address the epidemic at her own expense: she personally led a team of hundreds to prepare ammonia drinks, and had the Great Post Road and the road to Pelabuhan Ratu disinfected with oil. Zecha also raised funds and supplies for outbreaks of famines in China in the early twentieth century, for which she was honoured by the Qing Dynasty authorities.\n\nZecha died in 1939. The historian Theodore Friend relates: 'When the grand dame was dying, she had a gramophone put on the table next to her bed and ordered \"You don't cry, you play me my favorite Viennese waltzes.\" Her family kept her body in state over ice for weeks, until friends from all over the world could come to final services.'\n\nZecha's descendants from both of her marriages have maintained their prominence, despite the Revolution of 1945-1950, in Indonesia and the region to this day. Her great-grandson, the hotelier Adrian Lauw-Zecha, is the founder of Aman Resorts, while her granddaughter, the ballerina Che Engku Chesterina, is a princess by marriage of Negeri Sembilan in Malaysia.\n\nReferences\n\n1848 births\n1939 deaths\nLauw-Sim-Zecha family\nCabang Atas\nIndonesian people of Czech descent\nIndo people\nPeople from Batavia, Dutch East Indies",

        "Birds of Tokyo are an Australian alternative rock band from Perth, Western Australia. Their debut album, Day One, gained them domestic success, reaching number three on the AIR Independent Album charts and spending a total of 36 consecutive weeks in the top ten.\n\nIn 2008, the band released Universes, which made it to number three on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart. 2010 saw the band's self-titled third studio release Birds of Tokyo spend over eight months on the Australian top 20, peaking at number two on the ARIA Albums Chart. The double platinum album received the 2010 ARIA Award for Best Rock Album and in early 2011 the band's breakthrough hit \"Plans\" ranked number four on Triple J's Hottest 100. The album's follow-up single, \"Wild at Heart\", reached number one on the country's national airplay chart and won the band an APRA Award.\n\nIn 2013, the band released their fourth studio album March Fires. Supported by the album's first two singles \"This Fire\" and \"Lanterns\", March Fires debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart—the band's first number-one record. The album was certified gold within four weeks of release and the triple platinum single \"Lanterns\" was the most played song on Australian radio for the first six months of 2013.\n\nThe band released their fifth studio album Brace in November 2016. Their sixth studio album, Human Design, was released in April 2020. It topped the Australian charts upon its release.\n\nHistory\n\n2004–2005: Early years\nBirds of Tokyo formed in 2004 from a collaboration between members of another Perth act Tragic Delicate and Karnivool, from which Ian Kenny came. The group formed after guitarist Adam Spark asked Kenny to sing on a handful of commercial demos. The results were so good, they decided to form a band and release the songs themselves. They took their name from an article one member had read about the absence of birds in Tokyo's high-density central business district due to pollution and overcrowding. \"We thought that was interesting, no birds in Tokyo – we thought, we'll be the birds of Tokyo\", he says.\n\nIn January 2005, Birds of Tokyo released their debut EP, Birds of Tokyo. In October 2005, Birds of Tokyo released a double A side single \"One Way/Stay\". It was recorded in Melbourne with acclaimed producer Forrester Savell (Helmet, Full Scale, Karnivool).\n\n2006–2007: Day One\n2006 saw the band touring regional Western Australia on a three-week tour in January, before returning to Melbourne to finish working on their debut album, Day One. The album was released on 3 February 2007 and debuted at No. 88 on the ARIA Albums Chart and No. 3 on the AIR albums chart.\n\nDirectly following the release, the band embarked on extensive touring, starting with their \"Day One\" tour, playing in five capital cities around Australia. Birds of Tokyo also performed at the Perth leg of the 2007 Big Day Out and the at Blackjack 2007 (the relocated Rock-It festival).\n\nBirds of Tokyo were nominated for two awards in the 2007 AIR Awards (Australian Independent Record Association) for Best Performing Independent Album and Most Outstanding New Independent Artist. \"Wayside\" was voted in at No. 61 in Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2007.\n\nThey were also recognized in Rolling Stone magazine as 'Artists to Watch' in 2007.\n\n2008–2009: Universes\nThe band recorded their second album Universes in Margaret River, Western Australia, which was mixed in Los Angeles by Tim Palmer (Pearl Jam, Porcupine Tree). The debut single from the album, \"Silhouettic\", was released as a free download on 14 April 2008. The album was released 5 July 2008 and debuted at No. 3 on the ARIA Albums Chart and at No. 1 on the AIR albums chart. The album reached gold status in Australia in January 2009.\n\nThe band played all Australian shows at the Big Day Out in 2009. \"Broken Bones\", \"Silhouettic\" and \"Wild Eyed Boy\" were voted in at No. 20, No. 22 and No. 51 respectively in the Hottest 100 of 2008.\n\nIn late 2009, the band embarked on the Broken Strings tour, which featured acoustic interpretations of a selection of their work to date, accompanied by a string quartet and grand piano arranged by producer Anthony Cormican. The supporting artist was Glenn Richards (lead singer of Augie March). A CD and DVD featuring recordings from the tour was available to preorder at the shows, and was released in early 2010 as The Broken Strings Tour. Birds of Tokyo were nominated for the 2009 Channel V Oz Artist of the Year.\n\n2010–2011: Birds of Tokyo\nIn early 2010, the band returned to the studio to work on their eponymous third album. In March 2010 the band released the single \"The Saddest Thing I Know\" and announced an Australian tour by the same name. They toured with the New Zealand-based band Midnight Youth. The second single \"Plans\" was premiered on Sunday 20 June. The album was released on 23 July 2010. They toured with Silversun Pickups in September and October 2010. Birds of Tokyo received six 2010 ARIA Music Awards nominations. \"Wild at Heart\" was the album's third single. \"Plans\" was voted at No. 4 in the Hottest 100 of 2010, while \"Wild at Heart\" and \"The Saddest Thing I Know\" also appeared at No. 47 and No. 87, respectively. The band also played at the Big Day Out in 2011 for their third time.\n\nIn March 2011, the band announced via their Facebook page that bass player Anthony Jackson was leaving the band. Ian Berney from Sugar Army later filled the position.\n\nIn April 2011, they played alongside Art vs Science, The Jezabels and local Joshy Willo at the Triple J One Night Stand at Tumby Bay, South Australia.\n\nThe band were nominated in five different categories at the 2011 West Australian Music Industry Awards (WAMi), including Most Popular Act, Most Popular Album, Best Male Vocalist, Best Instrumentalist and Best Bassist. The band won for Most Popular Album and Best Instrumentalist.\n\nIn late April/early May 2011, Birds of Tokyo played at the annual Groovin' the Moo music festival alongside other Australian artists like Gotye, Washington, Art vs Science and Architecture in Helsinki.\n\nThe band toured through September and October 2011, their final national tour for the year. The tour was called the Closer Tour due to the fact that they opted to play smaller venues than they had played prior.\n\nDuring an interview on Radar, Adam revealed that the band would be heading back into the studio to record their new album over the summer.\n\n2012–2014: March Fires\nOn 1 February 2012, the band announced that they had finished writing their new album and would start recording the week after. Creating the new album was a journey of \"exploration and reinvention\" for Birds of Tokyo, telling the story of burning down the old and coming together to build something new. In October 2012, the band released an EP titled This Fire, which featured two songs (\"This Fire\" and \"Boy\") from the album. On 14 January 2013, \"Lanterns\" was released as a single, with its video coming out on 8 February. After being available for preorder on iTunes for 3 months, March Fires was released on 1 March 2013.\n\nLed by the first two singles, March Fires debuted at No. 1 on the ARIA Albums Chart, making it the band's first No. 1 record. The album was certified gold within four weeks of release and the triple platinum single \"Lanterns\" was the most played song on Australia radio in the first six months of 2013. \"When the Night Falls Quiet\" was later released as a single, with its video coming out on 22 April.\n\nBirds of Tokyo completed a sell-out tour of Australia to accompany the release and received positive reviews for shows across their March Fires album tour. They also performed at the 2013 AFL Grand Final, Splendour in the Grass 2013 and were announced as the sole support for Muse on their national Australian tour across November and December.\n\n2015–2017: Playlist and Brace\nOn 24 April 2015, the group released their third EP, Anchor. The EP was supported by a national tour and the release of a single of the same name. The music video for that song was released the following month. Birds of Tokyo subsequently debuted a new song, \"I'd Go with You Anywhere\", confirming the release of a compilation album, Playlist, which was released in November 2015 and peaked at number 4. The group released their fifth studio album Brace in November 2016. The album peaked at number 3 on the ARIA charts.\n\n2018–2020: Human Design\nIn September 2018, Birds of Tokyo released \"Unbreakable\". The song was chosen as the theme for the 2018 Invictus Games in Sydney. Birds of Tokyo performed the track at the official Closing Ceremony on 27 October at Sydney Super Dome. In February 2019, Birds of Tokyo released \"Good Lord\" which peaked at number 19 on the ARIA charts. This was followed by the singles \"The Greatest Mistakes\" and \"Two of Us\".\n\nIn February 2020, AFL team West Coast Eagles revealed a revamped official club song, which was produced by bass player Ian Berney and sung by vocalist Ian Kenny.\n\nIn February 2020, the band announced the forthcoming release of their sixth studio album, Human Design, released in April 2020. The album debuted at number 1 on the ARIA charts, becoming the band's second chart topper.\n\n2021–present: \"Superglue\" and \"Smith Street\"\nOn 17 September 2021 the band released \"Superglue\" with Stand Atlantic. The song is described as the \"first taste of a new batch of tunes\" the band have spent the past year working on.\n\nFor the second time, Birds of Tokyo performed at the AFL Grand Final. At the 2021 Grand Final half-time show, they played \"Lanterns\", a cover of Silverchair's \"Straight Lines\", and the song \"Unbreakable\", which was dedicated to hospital workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOn 18 March 2022, the bands released \"Smith Street\", which was written in the depths of the 2021 Victorian and NSW COVID-19 lockdowns and is an ode to the iconic street in Melbourne's north of the same name.\n\nOn 18 November 2022, the band released \"Daylight\".\n\nIn September 2023, the band will perform with shows with Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.\n\nMembers\nCurrent members\n Ian Kenny – vocals (2004–present)\n Adam Spark – guitars, keyboards, vocals (2004–present)\n Adam Weston – drums, percussion (2004–present)\n Ian Berney – bass (2011–present)\n Glenn Sarangapany – keyboards, synthesisers, vocals (2011–present)\n\nPast members\n Anthony Jackson – bass (2004–2011)\n\nDiscography\n\nDay One (2007)\nUniverses (2008)\nBirds of Tokyo (2010)\nMarch Fires (2013)\nBrace (2016)\nHuman Design (2020)\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nAIR Awards\nThe Australian Independent Record Awards (commonly known informally as AIR Awards) is an annual awards night to recognise, promote and celebrate the success of Australia's Independent Music sector.\n\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2007\n|themselves\n| Most Outstanding New Independent Artist\n| \n|-\n| Day One\n| Best Performing Independent Album\n| \n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | 2008\n| themselves\n| Best Independent  Artist\n| \n|-\n| Universes\n| Best Independent Hard Rock/Punk Album\n| \n|-\n| 2010\n|themselves  \n| Most Popular Independent Artist\n| \n|-\n\nAPRA Awards\n\nThe APRA Awards are presented annually from 1982 by the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), \"honouring composers and songwriters\".\n\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\"| 2011 || rowspan=\"4\"|\"Plans\" (Anthony Jackson, Ian Kenny, Adam Spark, Adam Weston) || Breakthrough Songwriter of the Year || \n|-\n| Most Played Australian Work || \n|-\n| Rock Work of the Year || \n|-\n| Song of the Year || \n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 2012 || rowspan=\"2\"|\"Wild at Heart\" (Anthony Jackson, Ian Kenny, Adam Spark, Adam Weston) || Rock Work of the Year || \n|-\n| Most Played Australian Work || \n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 2013 || rowspan=\"2\"| \"This Fire\" (Ian Berney, Ian Kenny, Glen Sarangapany, Adam Spark, Adam Westonn) || Rock Work of the Year || \n|-\n| Song of the Year || \n|-\n| rowspan=\"4\" | 2014 || rowspan=\"3\" | \"Lanterns\" (Ian Berney, Ian Kenny, Glenn Sarangapany, Adam Spark, Adam Weston) || Most Played Australian Work || \n|-\n| Rock Work of the Year || \n|-\n| Song of the Year || \n|-\n| \"When the Night Falls Quiet\" (Ian Berney, Ian Kenny, Glen Sarangapany, Adam Spark, Adam Weston) || Rock Work of the Year || \n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 2016 || rowspan=\"2\"|\"Anchor\" (Ian Berney, Ian Kenny, Glen Sarangapany, Adam Spark, Adam Weston) || Rock Work of the Year || \n|-\n| Song of the Year || \n|-\n| 2017 || \"I'd Go with You Anywhere\" (Berney, Kenny, Sarangapany, Spark, Weston) || Rock Work of the Year || \n|-\n| 2018 || \"Brace\" (Berney, Kenny, Sarangapany, Spark, Weston) || Rock Work of the Year || \n|-\n|rowspan=\"3\"| 2020 ||rowspan=\"3\"| \"Good Lord\" (Berney, Kenny, Sarangapany, Spark, Adam Weston) || Most Performed Australian Work of the Year || \n|-\n||Most Performed Alternative Work of the Year || \n|-\n||Song of the Year || \n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 2021 ||rowspan=\"2\"| \"Two of Us\" (Berney, Kenny, Sarangapany, Spark, Weston) || Most Performed Alternative Work || \n|-\n| Song of the Year\n| \n|-\n\nARIA Music Awards\nThe ARIA Music Awards is an annual awards ceremony that recognises excellence, innovation, and achievement across all genres of Australian music. \n\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"|2010\n|rowspan=\"2\"|Birds of Tokyo\n|Best Rock Album\n|\n|-\n|Album of the Year\n|\n|-\n|\"Plans\"\n|Single of the Year\n|\n|-\n| The Broken Strings Tour DVD\n| Best Music DVD\n|\n|-\n| Birds Of Tokyo  \n| Most Popular Australian Artist\n|\n|-\n| Birds Of Tokyo\n| Best Group\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"|2011\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\"Wild At Heart\"\n| Best Group\n| \n|-\n| Single of the Year \n| \n|-\n| \"Plans\"\n| Highest Selling Single \n| \n|-\n| Birds Of Tokyo\n| Highest Selling Album \n| \n|-\n| Birds Of Tokyo\n| Most Popular Australian Live Act\n| \n|-\n| Birds Of Tokyo \n| Most Popular Australian Artist\n| \n|-\n|rowspan=\"6\"|2013\n|rowspan=\"3\"|March Fires\n| Album of the Year \n| \n|-\n| Best Group \n| \n|-\n| Best Rock Album\n| \n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\"Lanterns\"\n| Song of the Year \n| \n|-\n| Best Video\n| \n|-\n| March Fires Tour\n| Best Australian Live Act \n| \n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"|2019\n|rowspan=\"2\"|\"Good Lord\"\n|Best Group\n|\n|-\n|Song of the Year\n|\n|-\n\nJ Awards\nThe J Awards are an annual series of Australian music awards that were established by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's youth-focused radio station Triple J.

        "In-Gall (var. In Gall, I-n-Gall, In-Gal, Ingal, Ingall) is a town in the Agadez Region, Tchirozerine Department of northeast Niger, with a year-round population of less than 500. Known for its oasis and salt flats, In-Gall is the gathering point for the Cure Salee festival of Tuareg and Wodaabe pastoralists to celebrate the end of the rainy season each September. During the festival, In-Gall's population grows to several thousand nomads, officials, and tourists. As of 2011, the commune had a total population of 47,170 people.\n\nIn-Gall had been a stop on the main roads between the capital of Niger, Niamey (600 km to the southwest), and the mining town of Arlit (200 km to the northeast, 150 km from the Algerian border) or the provincial capital Agadez (100 km to the east).  In the 1970s, the main road was repaved to transport uranium from the French-owned mines in Arlit, but the new road bypassed In-Gall, ending its use as a waystation.  Since then, its population has dropped from almost 5,000 to less than 500.\n\nDuring the Tuareg insurgency of the 1990s, In-Gall was a prime fortification of the Niger armed forces, and when peace was concluded in 2000 the old fort was reportedly abandoned.\n\nDescription\n\"InGall, an oasis town in a semi-desert zone that forms the gateway to the Sahara. InGall is a conglomeration of mud houses, whose gardens, in contrast to the barren landscape in which the town is set, are filled with fruit trees and vegetable patches.\"\n\nHistory\nThe history, archaeology, and culture of the In-Gall area has been extensively studied, most notably by the French anthropologist and archaeologist couple, Suzanne and Edmond Bernus.\n\nIn-Gall is not only a prominent Tuareg seasonal centre, to which certain clans return each year, but it has a history as a stop in the Trans-Saharan trade, was an eastern outpost of the Songhay Empire in the 16th century, was an important centre of the Aïr Sultanate thereafter, and became a French colonial fort in an often hostile region in the early 20th century.\n\nPre-history\nArchaeological evidence shows the area as a centre of prehistoric populations dating back some eight thousand year to when it sat in the midst of a now dry Azawagh river valley, fed by the Aïr Massif and flowing south to the Niger River. Of particular note have been thousands of pre-common era stone burial mounds which suggest a common culture in the area.  Archeologists have also found in the In-Gall region many of the earliest mosques in Niger, dating back to early Berber occupations before 1000CE.\n\nSalt extraction\nIn-Gall is intimately linked with the nearby salt industry at Teguidda-n-Tessoumt, around 15 km to the north. Teguidda, on the site of an ancient lake bed, floods as water washes down from the Aïr Massif to the east each year, producing natural salt ponds. The population of In-Gall maintain and harvest from evaporation ponds here, sending labourers from the local clans to work the salt and transport it back to In-Gall at the end of the season.  In-Gall is near enough that, unlike the oasis town of Fachi where plots are owned by Agadez-based Tuareg clans and worked by a permanent population, the workers at Teguidda return to In-Gall for the remainder of the year.  Teguidda also lacks a stable oasis, which provides In-Gall with market gardens and date palm farming on a year-round basis.  Prior to its decline in the 20th century — because of the smaller scale of the In-Gall salt markets as well as its easy access by road — In-Gall was once a destination of the Azalai salt caravans, in which Tuareg merchants transported salt from the markets here across the Sahel for agricultural and medicinal uses.\n\nUranium mining\nIn 2004, a Canadian corporation was granted a government license to mine for uranium in the area.  Northwestern Mineral Ventures was awarded the Irhazer and Ingall concessions, each  in size.  Mines would reportedly be \"open pit\" strip mines. More than 100 uranium exploration licenses have been granted in the Azawagh area since 2004 to foreign firms from China (over 40%), Canada, and India. Since 2007, a Chinese mining consortium, whose license covers an area north of In-Gall, has carried out infrastructural work for new uranium mine at Azelik, some 85 km north of in Gall, which includes extending roads from In-Gall to the site. Nigerien human rights, environmental and Tuareg groups have argued that mining activities in this region are a threat to scarce water resources, upon which pastoralists depend.  The short rainy season in the Azawagh area north and west of In-Gall makes the region the northern destination for a cattle and camel herding transhumance cycle, which sees communities travel as far south as Burkina Faso during the dry months.\n\nDinosaurs\nIn-Gall is also famous to outsiders for its palaeontological digs, most notably the Jobaria tiguidensis, and the remains of petrified forests dating back 135 million years.\n\nReferences\n\n Abdoulkader Aghali, Koffi Kouassi.

        "Langjökull (, Icelandic for \"long glacier\") is the second largest ice cap in Iceland (953 km2), after Vatnajökull. It is situated in the west of the Icelandic interior or Highlands of Iceland and can be seen clearly from Haukadalur.\n\nIts volume is 195 km³ and the ice is up to  thick. The highest point of the ice cap (at Baldjökull  at the northern end of Langjökull) is about  above sea level.\n\nIn the past, the largest recorded surface area was in 1840.\n\nSituation and form\n\nThe glacier is roughly parallel to the direction of the country's active volcanic zone: north-east to south-west. It is about  long and  wide, and has a slightly narrower point roughly between the lake Hvítárvatn on the Kjölur mountain road to the east and the Þrístapajökull glacier to the west, near another smaller glacier, Eiríksjökull, which is not quite connected to Langjökull. It is the nearest large glacier to Reykjavík.\n\nThe area of the glacier includes some mountains, e.g. Jarlhettur (; \"The earl's hat\") on the east side of Langjökull, a palagonitic mountain range, which originated in a fissure vent under a glacier during the Ice Age.\n\nThe mountain Skríðufell  () is situated on the east, above lake Hvítárvatn. Other mountains on the eastern side of Langjökull are Fjallkirkja  (), Þursaborg  () and Péturshorn  ().\n\nA little to the east of Fjallkirkja is the hut of the Icelandic Glacier Research Society (also called Jöklarannsóknarfélag in the ), which includes scientists as well as interested amateurs.\n\nGlaciers in the area\n\nA number of outlet glaciers reach down from Langjökull to the valleys and plains below. These include Norðurjökull  and Suðurjökull  to the east; Vestri-Hagafellsjökull  and Eystri-Hagafellsjökull  at the southern end of Langjökull which are separated by the mountain Hagafell ; and Þrístapajökull  to the west. Geitlandsjökull (1395m) is an outpost to the southwest, a glacier covering a tuya which is connected to Langjökull.\n\nResearch shows that the outlet glaciers Norður- and Suðurjökull reached as far as lake Hvítárvatn until about 1900 but have retreated rapidly since then.\n\nWater flow and development of the glacier\nDespite the size of Langjökull, not many rivers directly originate there. However research has shown that large quantities of water flow in sub-surface streams to lake Þingvallavatn (some 50 km to the south and easily accessible to tourists) and reappear in springs in and around the lake, while the same happens on the west side, giving rise to various tributaries of the Hvítá River as well as some rivers flowing north towards Húnaflói. Thus many of the hot springs in the Borgarfjörður region (near the estuary of the Hvítá on the west coast), such as Deildartunguhver, receive ground water from Langjökull.\n\nThe same is true for the lake Hvítárvatn to the east: ⅔ of its waters appear to come from Langjökull by underwater channels.\n\nLangjökull is shrinking quite fast, and some researchers believe that it will disappear in about 150 years if climate change continues at its recent pace.\n\nVolcanism\n\nUnder Langjökull there are two or more volcanic systems. The calderas can easily be seen from the air. The best known of these is Hveravellir with its hot spring and high temperature area to the east of the glacier. During an Ice Age some shield volcanoes of this system covered the plains with lava in the region of today's Kjölur mountain road: the Kjalhraun (; hraun means \"lava field\"). The lava field is about 7,800 years old.\n\nA smaller volcanic system lies to the north-west of the glacier in the  , north of the glacier Eiríksjökull. About 1,000 years ago, the craters of this system produced the lava field Hallmundarhraun  which extends some 50 km westward into the valley of the Hvítá, and is traversed by underground streams which emerge at the waterfalls of Hraunfossar not far from Húsafell.\n\nAnother volcanic system to the south-west of Langjökull is Presthnúkur, named after its central volcano, a rhyolite dome with a high temperature area at its foot. Its fissures extend under Langjökull.\n\nVolcanically, the region is relatively quiet, compared to other regions in Iceland, with just 32 eruptions in the last 10,000 years.\n\nHighland roads\n\nTwo highland tracks, open in the summer months, lead alongside this glacier: the Kaldidalur and Kjölur tracks.\n\nThe former (road 550) runs along the west of Langjökull, between it and the small Ok glacier. To the south it leads towards Þingvellir and Reykjavík, while to the north it leads to the Hvítá valley which leads down towards Borgarnes. Kaldidalur is no longer classified by the Icelandic road authorities as an F-road. Nevertheless, rental car companies forbid their clients to drive on the road with other cars than four-wheel drives. \nRoad F551 goes right to the edge of the glacier from Kaldidalur.\n\nThe latter (road F35) runs along the east side of Langjökull, between it and Hofsjökull. It is the main route across the interior between the main population centres in the SW and the N of the country, but nevertheless traffic is extremely sparse.\n\nTourism\nLangjökull attracts visitors who are captivated by its immense size and natural beauty. The glacier offers a unique experience for adventure enthusiasts and nature lovers alike. With its easily accessible location in the Icelandic interior, Langjökull provides opportunities for various activities, such as glacier hiking, snowmobiling, monster truck ride, and exploring natural ice caves and man-made tunnels. These experiences provide a different perspective of the glacier and its surroundings, enhancing the overall visit to Langjökull.\n\nLocated near popular tourist routes like the Golden Circle, Langjökull holds a prominent position in Iceland's tourism industry. Its significant contribution to the surrounding natural wonders, such as Gullfoss waterfall and Geysir's geothermal area, adds to its allure. The glacier's proximity to these iconic sites makes it a sought-after destination for travelers seeking to witness the awe-inspiring effects of glacial forces on the landscape.\n\nIt is important to note the importance of responsible tourism practices to preserve and protect Langjökull. Visitors are encouraged to respect the environment and follow sustainable guidelines to ensure the long-term preservation of this remarkable glacier.\n\nIn popular culture \nThe glacier is featured in the final scene of the 1999 animated film The Iron Giant, directed by Brad Bird, where the titular Giant's parts, scattered by his destruction at the film's climax, converge on his head to begin reassembling him.\n\nSee also\n Geography of Iceland\n Iceland plume\n List of glaciers\n List of glaciers of Iceland\n List of islands of Iceland\n List of lakes of Iceland\n List of rivers of Iceland\n List of volcanoes in Iceland\n List of waterfalls of Iceland\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nLangjökull in the Catalogue of Icelandic Volcanoes\nPhoto of Langjökull\nGwenn E.

        "Rishi Bhat (born May 19, 1984) is an American former child actor and internet entrepreneur.\n\nPersonal life \nBhat is of Indian descent. His parents are immigrants to the United States. His father Shrikant is a metallurgical engineer. Bhat's interest in computers began when he received his first computer at the age of three years. Bhat is an alumnus of the University of Pennsylvania, where he obtained both bachelor's and master's degrees in computer science/mathematics, in a total of 4 years.\n\nCareer\n\nActor \nBhat held the role of Patrick, co-starring alongside Hal Scardino and Litefoot in the 1995 film The Indian in the Cupboard, for which he received a Young Artist Award nomination.\n\nSoftware entrepreneur \nBetween the fall of 1999 and spring of 2000, Bhat sold two internet startups, SiegeSoft.com and myEDesk.com, to a Canadian software firm.\n\nSiegeSoft was written by Bhat during the summer of 1999, while a sophomore at the University of Chicago Laboratory School. When a summer pre-calculus class he wished to take was canceled, he instead spent the time writing SiegeSoft as an anonymity software program to allow users to surf the internet without leaving a trail.\n\nOriginally sold online, SiegeSoft hides subscribers' identities when they use the internet and scrambles records of sites visited. Though competing software began to materialize online, SiegeSoft was determined to be both more secure and easier to use than existing software. Rocca Resources, a Vancouver-based mineral-exploration company, purchased SiegeSoft from Bhat for $40,000 cash, 1.5 million shares of Rocca stock, plus shares in Rocca's first two years of profits in exchange for Bhat's continued work on refining the program. Rocca later purchased the startup MyEdesk.com from Bhat and his partner Chaitanya Mehra, with each receiving 110,000 shares of Rocca stock.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n Rishi Bhat at Cyber Spacers\n\n1984 births\nLiving people\nAmerican male child actors\nAmerican businesspeople\nAmerican male actors of Indian descent\nBusinesspeople in information technology\nMale actors from Chicago\nUniversity of Chicago Laboratory Schools alumni\nUniversity of Pennsylvania alumni",

        "Indy Week, formerly known as the Independent Weekly and originally the North Carolina Independent, is a tabloid-format alternative weekly newspaper published in Durham, North Carolina, United States, and distributed throughout the Research Triangle area (Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill, and Cary) and counties (Wake County, Durham County, Orange County, and Chatham County). Its first issue was published in April 1983.\n\nIndy Week is a member of the Association of Alternative Newsmedia  and has a progressive, liberal political perspective. The Columbia Journalism Review has cited the newspaper for its \"spine of steel.\" The print edition is published on Wednesdays.\n\nHistory\nThe paper was founded in 1983 by Steve Schewel and was originally published as the North Carolina Independent and was bi-weekly.  Its publisher was Carolina Independent Publications, Inc.  It was renamed the Independent effective March 1985. In April 1988 the Independent published endorsements of state political candidates for the upcoming Democratic Party's primary election. The paper admonished its readers not to vote for state senator Harold Hardison and in response a member of Hardison's campaign organization collected approximately 7,000 copies of the paper from newsstands in downtown Raleigh and dumped them in the trash. The Independent identified the person responsible and reported the story in its next edition. The story was reported by media across North Carolina, raising the newspaper's public profile. In 1989, publication was changed to weekly, and the name altered to the Independent Weekly.\n\nIn September 2002, Carolina Independent Publications acquired the area's other major weekly, the Spectator, from Creative Loafing Inc. Founded in 1978 by Godfrey Cheshire and others in Raleigh,  the Spectator had been owned by Creative Loafing since 1997 and was well known for its coverage of the arts; the name lived on as the name of the Independent's calendar of events.\n\nIn 2010, the Independent presented the inaugural Hopscotch Music Festival in downtown Raleigh. The three-day annual event happens in September and features local, national and international bands.\n\nOn September 27, 2012, the Independent Weekly was purchased by ZM INDY, Inc., whose owners, Mark Zusman and Richard Meeker, also own Willamette Week. The name of the newspaper and website was changed to Indy Week.\n\nOn June 11, 2020, Jeffrey Billman was fired from his position as Editor.  The stated reason was that he had failed to follow up on a sexual misconduct tip regarding a local restaurant that had been brought to his attention in May 2019. Possibly prompting the dismissal, the edit and design staff released a letter stating their unwillingness to work for Billman going forward.\nJane Porter started as Editor-in-Chief in January 2021.\n\nAwards \nThe paper's reporters have won several major awards, including the George Polk Award, the Investigative Reporters and Editors Award (finalist), the Green Eyeshade Award for the South's best journalism (second place, 2004, 2005 & 2019), the Baltimore Suns H.L. Mencken Writing Award, and the Casey Medal for Meritorious Journalism.\n\nSee also\n The Santa Fe Reporter, also published by Richard Meeker and Mark Zusman\nWillamette Week (Willamette, OR), also published by Meeker & Zusman.\n\nReferences\n\nWorks cited\n\nExternal links\n\nAlternative weekly newspapers published in the United States\nMass media in Durham, North Carolina\nWeekly newspapers published in North Carolina\nIndependent newspapers published in the United States\nNewspapers established in 1983\n1983 establishments in North Carolina",

        "The book 2 Maccabees contains 15 chapters.  It is a deuterocanonical book originally written in Greek that is part of the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Christian biblical canons.  It is still considered an important source on the Maccabean Revolt by Jews, Protestants, and secular historians of the period who do not necessarily hold the book as part of a scriptural canon.  The chapters chronicle events in Judea from around 178–161 BCE during the Second Temple Period.  Judea was at the time ruled by the Seleucid Empire, one of the Greek successor states that resulted from the conquests of Alexander the Great.  2 Maccabees was written by an unknown Egyptian Jew.  The account is distinct from the book 1 Maccabees, which was written by someone in the Hasmonean kingdom that was formed after the success of the revolt.  In general, 2 Maccabees has a more directly religious perspective than 1 Maccabees, frequently directly crediting prayers, miraculous interventions, and divine will for events.\n\nThe most influential chapters of the book are likely Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 which deal with the martyrdom of the woman with seven sons and Eleazar the scribe during the persecution of Judaism under King Antiochus IV Epiphanes.  Chapter 7 and Chapter 12 both discuss a coming bodily resurrection of the righteous; 2 Maccabees is one of the earliest pieces of literature to advocate for this belief.  Chapter 15 is also one of the earliest references to the Jewish festival of Purim.  While 2 Maccabees was originally written for an audience of Hellenistic Jews, verses in its chapters have been used in some branches of Christianity as scriptural backing for indulgences, prayers for the dead, and the intercession of saints.  These became controversial during the Protestant Reformation, and was one of the factors that led to Protestant denominations considering the book as non-canonical.\n\nLike other books of the Bible, the division of the text into chapters and verses was not in its original form, and was instead added later.\n\nChapters 1 and 2\n\nThe first two chapters are an introduction and not part of the main narrative, which begins in Chapter 3.  They consist of two letters to the Jews of Ptolemaic Egypt, followed by the epitomist's preface.  Some earlier scholars such as Benedikt Niese interpreted it as one long letter, although this position finds little support since the work of Elias Bickerman in the 1930s in favor of seeing the text as two letters.\n\nMany scholars question whether these letters were truly authentic, especially the second one which appears to have, if based on an authentic letter at some point, been affected by manuscript interpolations over time.  There are also questions of whether the epitomist who wrote the main narrative was who attached these letters to the beginning of the narrative, or if some other compiler did so.  Arguments against the epitomist being the one who prepended the letters include that the epitomist's preface appears to be written as if it was an introduction already, with the two letters detracting from this literarily; that the account of King Antiochus's death in 1:13-16 differs from the account in Chapter 9; and that the epitomist's narrative builds toward Nicanor's Day as the finale and most important lesson, while the letters instead focus on Hanukkah and the cleansing of the Temple.\n\nFirst letter\n\nThe first letter, from 1:1-1:10a, is an invitation to celebrate the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem: the festival of Hanukkah.   It opens with a salutation and stylized expressions of good will.  It then segues into a brief summary of how the troubles began with High Priest Jason (described in Chapter 4), a reminder of how the Jews of Judea called out for aid from the Jews of Egypt in the past, and closes with the encouragement of Hanukkah celebration for diaspora Jews (1:9-1:10a): \"And now see that you keep the festival of booths in the month of Chislev, in the one hundred and eighty-eighth year.\"  The year 188 of the Seleucid era (SE) is equivalent to 124–123 BCE.  If interpreted as a reference to the letter originally being sent then, it would suggest that the form of 2 Maccabees we have today was arranged in that year or later.\n\nAnother date of interest is found in verse 7, that \"In the reign of Demetrius, in the one hundred and sixty-ninth year, we Jews wrote to you,\" suggesting that the letter is referencing an earlier letter.  169 SE would correspond to 143 BCE, which was indeed during the reign of a Demetrius: King Demetrius II Nicator.  According to , the nascent Hasmonean state was dealing with the hostile Diodotus Tryphon at the time, and allied with Demetrius II against him.  The letter suggests that perhaps the Jews of Judea had also reached out to the Jews of Egypt for support against Tryphon.\n\nSecond letter\n\nThe second letter, from 1:10b to 2:18, is purportedly a letter from the gerusia (Council of Elders) of Jerusalem and Judas Maccabeus upon receiving news of the death of King Antiochus IV Epiphanes but before the celebration of the first feast of the Dedication of the Temple (Hanukkah), and thus an earlier letter than the first one.  It seems to be addressed to Aristobulus of Alexandria, a figure mentioned by Clement of Alexandria and Eusebius.  The letter describes the death of Antiochus while attacking a temple dedicated to the goddess Nanaya in Persia and how God saved Jerusalem by expelling \"those who drew themselves up to war\".\n\nThe letter then continues an extended analogy going backward in time tying Judas's Temple to figures in the Jewish past.  The priest Nehemiah (5th century BCE) is said to have found a special liquid used to kindle the altar's holy fire called nephthar or nephthai (perhaps related to naphtha or petroleum).  The liquid was then poured into rocks.  The story continues with how the prophet Jeremiah (6th–7th century BCE) hid both the liquid and various other Temple appurtenances for Nehemiah to find later.  It also includes a brief story that King Solomon (10th century BCE) prayed for fire from heaven in a manner similar to Moses, which consumed a sacrifice.  He then proceeded to celebrate for eight days.  The letter writes that Nehemiah also established a library of writings and books, and that Judas has followed his example and done likewise, compiling a library of Jewish histories.  The story of Nehemiah pouring the mysterious liquid into the rocks is possibly related to 10:3 which states that after purifying the Temple, Judas \"ignited rocks and extracted fire from them\".  This would establish a direct link between the altar of Nehemiah and Judas's temple.  The theological intent is to tie Judas's cleansed temple to the original First Temple and establish it as equally legitimate.  The altar fire came from heaven to Solomon; Jeremiah hid the Temple items and the fire as a way of ensuring the survival of the Temple for the future in a way beyond the reach of foreign rule during the Babylonian exile; Nehemiah rediscovered it; and now Judas had reignited this same fire reaching all the way back to heaven.\n\nSimilar to the first letter, it concludes with an invitation for the Jews of Egypt to join the Jews in Judea in simultaneously celebrating Hanukkah, an eight-day celebration of purification and fire, akin to Solomon's claimed celebration.  Presumably, Egyptian Jews needed convincing, as the feast of Hanukkah was a new invention not described in the Hebrew Bible.\n\nWhile some sort of letter from Judas to Egypt existing cannot be ruled out, scholars generally consider large parts of the letter forged or interpolated at a much later date than when Judas was alive.  Jonathan A. Goldstein finds signs that the letter's claimed chronology is questionable, and that the letter makes more sense as a later writing than the first epistle.  Many of the stories in the letter appear in no other piece of earlier literature—Nehemiah and the sacred fire, the quotes attributed to Moses, and so on.  Robert Doran suggests that the concerns in the letter suggest a more settled state of affairs for when it was authored, perhaps during the reign of later Hasmonean kings such as John Hyrcanus or Alexander Jannaeus.\n\nOne aspect of note is the location of the temple of Nanaya.  The letter indicates that it was in Persia, but Elymais is where the wealthy temple was according to 1 Maccabees, Josephus, and Appian.  It is unclear whether the author considered Elymais part of Persia or simply made a geographical error.\n\nIn later Jewish theology, Abraham Geiger, the founder of Reform Judaism, believed that verse 2:17 (\"It is God who has saved all his people, and has returned the inheritance to all, and the kingship and the priesthood and the consecration\") indicated the author had a belief in a universal priesthood shared by all Jews, and that the author of the letter had an anti-Sadducee bent.\n\nEpitomist's preface\n\nIn 2:19-32, the anonymous writer, referred to variously as the epitomist, the epitomator, the author, and the abridger, introduces himself and his work to the readers. He discusses his effort in making an abridgment, or epitome, of Jason of Cyrene's five-volume history and compares himself to a decorator who adds beauty to an existing structure. He is clearly someone possessed of a strong education in both Greek literature and Judaism.\n\nOne minor point of curiosity is that 2:19 refers to the exploits of \"Judas Maccabeus and his brothers\", yet the main history pays little attention to Judas's brothers, focusing on Judas personally instead. This is in contrast to 1 Maccabees, which often discussed and referred to the rest of the Hasmonean family. Whether the epitomist wanted to discuss and highlight the brothers but Jason's work simply discussed them little, or he played down the brothers in the main history but felt obligated to mention them in the preface due to their fame, is unclear.\n\nAnother aspect that comes across as odd to modern readers are the complaints of \"sweat and sleepless nights\" in composing the epitome in 2:26. While reading strangely today, such a statement of the author proclaiming how hard they worked was common in ancient prefaces of the era. A similar passage is also seen in .\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe third chapter recounts the story of Heliodorus's attempt to tax the Temple.  It is a self-contained story and a prelude to the main history of the revolt, but establishes that God protects the Second Temple when his people and their leaders are faithful.  During the term of Onias III as High Priest and Seleucus IV Philopator as king (reigned from 187–175 BCE), a Jewish supervisor named Simon has a falling out with Onias.  He tells the governor (ethnarch) that the Temple had a gigantic stockpile of illegal treasure that could be lawfully taken, as revenge on Onias.  The king sends Heliodorus to investigate.  Upon Heliodorus's arrival in Jerusalem, Onias denies Simon's claim; Heliodorus says that the money the Temple did have must nevertheless be impounded.  All Jerusalem prays for deliverance by God.  On the day that Heliodorus and his entourage visit the temple's treasury, a fearful apparition of a horseman wearing golden armor appears.  Two mysterious handsome and strong youths also appear, wearing splendid raiment, and standing on either side of Heliodorus , deliver a barrage of blows and floggings to him.  Heliodorus , near death, is carried off in a litter; his entourage begs Onias III for help.  Not wishing for trouble with the king, Onias III performs a sacrifice for Heliodorus's salvation and healing.  The youths, presumably angels, tell Heliodorus that he should be grateful to Onias, and that his new mission is to proclaim the greatness and power of God to all.  After he returns to Antioch, Heliodorus testifies to the power of God, and wryly suggests that Seleucus IV send some enemy of his to Jerusalem next, as he'll have him back flogged, if alive at all.\n\nThe basic historicity of such a tax dispute is uncontested.  The Book of Daniel seems to allude to the incident in .  The Heliodorus stele documents an order from Seleucus IV to Heliodorus in 178 BCE to attend to the temples of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, and the appointment of a person named Olympiodorus to supervise the province's temples.  While this perhaps suggests that it is more likely Olympiodorus was who visited Jerusalem's temple rather than Heliodorus personally, the basic memory of an attempt to interfere with the temple that was rebuffed is probably accurate, even if the more miraculous elements such as the heavenly horseman and handsome men are legendary.\n\nOnias III reports that the temple contained deposits belonging to widows and orphans, as well as the treasure of Hyrcanus son of Tobias totalling 400 silver talents and 200 gold talents.  In the era, gold talents were worth about 10 times silver talents, so this would be equivalent to 2400 talents—a large sum for the era, but not quite the incalculable treasure described by Simon.  For comparison, the Seleucids owed an annual tribute of 1,000 silver talents to Rome under the terms of the Treaty of Apamea.  Hyrcanus has usually been considered the same person as a Hyrcanus described in Josephus's work, a patriarch of the Tobiads.  One of his best-known traits was that he was wealthy, having grown rich during Ptolemaic rule of the region, although much of what is known of him is colored by folklore-style exaggerations.  Jonathan A. Goldstein argues the reference to him was added later by a follower of Onias IV; Robert Doran suggests it might be original, and the author was attempting to emphasize the unity of all Jews despite the known animosity against the Tobiads.\n\nTheologically, the author emphasizes that the inviolability and holiness of the Temple stems from the people and their leaders, a theme also seen in earlier Jewish writing.  The prelude thus serves as a positive counterpart to the troubles later.  The author also writes as a diaspora Jew living under Greek rule in Ptolemaic Egypt.  Thus, the return to the status quo ante of Jews living under tolerant Greek rule is not portrayed as problematic, but rather God's will and a suitably happy ending.  This contrasts with the more absolutist stance of the author of 1 Maccabees, who considers the only honorable peace one with Jewish autonomy and preferably independence.\n\nChapter 4\n\nChapter 4 is where the main history begins.  It depicts the turbulent temple politics of 175–168 BCE that saw the succession of Onias III, Jason, and Menelaus as High Priest.  Simon, from Chapter 3, continues his dispute with Onias III; Onias complains to the king about him.  After Seleucus IV's death, Antiochus IV Epiphanes comes to the throne (~175 BCE).  Jason, a brother of Onias III, offers a larger tribute to Antiochus than what Onias was paying, and is appointed the new High Priest.  He additionally acquires permission to reform parts of the city along Greek lines and to found a gymnasium for the education of the young in the Greek style.  The author accuses High Priest Jason of treating lightly the ancestral rights and guarantees of autonomy to the Jews with his innovations, and being impious and unpriestly.  Three years into Jason's rule, Menelaus, the brother of Simon who had disputed with Onias III earlier, was sent to the king to bring the temple's tribute.  Menelaus betrayed Jason, however, and offered Antiochus IV an even higher tribute if he was given the office of High Priest instead.  His gambit successful, Menelaus returned to Jerusalem with the king's orders to make him the new High Priest.  Jason was forced into exile to live among the Ammonites.  While Jason was an impious \"Hellenizer\", the author depicts Menelaus as both a Hellenizer and an outright criminal.  Menelaus embezzles golden artifacts from the Temple to sell.\n\nBack in Antioch, the king is away with the army to stabilize the discontent cities of Tarsus and Mallus in Cilicia, in the Anatolian peninsula.  He appoints a regent named Andronicus to be in charge during his absence.  Menelaus bribes Andronicus with such stolen treasure as well.  Onias III accuses Menelaus of the crime, then seeks sanctuary at a Greek shrine in Daphne.  Menelaus and Andronicus plot to get rid of Onias III, and Andronicus lures him outside the shrine to murder him.  Jews and righteous Greeks alike petition the king for justice for Andronicus's murder of Onias; Antiochus IV agrees and executes Andronicus on the same spot he killed Onias.  Back in Jerusalem, Menelaus is deeply unpopular for his continuing sale of golden vessels from the Temple.  He appoints a man named Lysimachus, one of his temple-robbers, to form a private police force to defend his rule.  Protesters and Lysimachus's force fight it out; the protesters prevail, and Lysimachus is defeated poetically near the treasury he had stolen from.  The Jews send a delegation to Tyre where the king is traveling to accuse Menelaus of his crimes.  Menelaus, however, sends a bribe to Ptolemy, son of Dorymenes, a Seleucid official who advocates on his behalf to Antiochus IV.  Menelaus is acquitted of the accusations, and the accusers themselves are executed.  As the chapter concludes, Menelaus continues in office thanks to Ptolemy's greed.\n\nThe depiction in Chapter 4 of the internal temple politics is found nowhere else in ancient sources; while 1 Maccabees and Josephus vaguely allude to disputes over the High Priesthood, they are bare-bones mentions.  2 Maccabees thus is generally allowed to stand on its own, undisputed, by most scholars.  The one area where sources differ is on the death of Onias III.  2 Maccabees says he was murdered by Andronicus at Menelaus's behest, and Andronicus was subsequently executed for the crime.  However, Josephus seems to indicate Onias III was still active in Egypt at a later date in his The Jewish War; and Diodorus Siculus gives a different reason for Andronicus's execution: that he had murdered a young son of Seleucus IV.  Most scholars consider both these accounts to be less reliable than 2 Maccabees: they are written much later; Josephus appears to contradict and correct his own history of the high priests in his Jewish Antiquities; and Diodorus's account is not strictly contradictory to the version in 2 Maccabees, if Andronicus was executed for multiple accumulated crimes over time and the author of 2 Maccabees chose to emphasize the one he cared about.  Another part considered questionable by some scholars is the story of Menelaus bribing one of the king's courtiers in Tyre rather than the king directly.  This is largely because it is exceptionally common in ancient literature to blame problems on a king's bad advisors rather than the king directly, as a less radical statement more likely to evade censorship, and the king is not portrayed as unhinged yet in this chapter.  However, the narrative directly blames Antiochus IV for evil acts later, so it is difficult to know for sure.  Another aspect seen as an exaggeration is the author depicting the street mob of protesters as armed with trash, yet defeating 3,000 armed men.  Some sort of civil disorder is plausible, but this is presumably an \"improvement\" on the actual incident to emphasize Lysimachus's just punishment by God.\n\nThe death of Onias III can be loosely dated to 170 BCE based on archaeological evidence, such as a cuneiform Babylonian kings list that seem to mention the death of the young son of Seleucus IV that Diodorus referenced as the reason of Andronicus's execution in 170 BCE.\n\n2 Maccabees puts the blame for events spirally downward squarely on impious Jews such as Jason and Menelaus in its theology.  Similar to Chapter 3, it directly calls out the potential support from righteous Gentiles in its story of how Andronicus was considered a murderer even by the Seleucids, and how the inhabitants of Tyre fund a proper funeral for the Jews who accused Menelaus.  This is again in contrast to 1 Maccabees, which has little interest in portraying the possibility of peaceful coexistence or non-hostile Gentiles.  Verses 18-22 also discusses a story of Jews who participate in the Hellenistic world while still safeguarding their faith, another message that would resonate with diaspora Jews.\n\nChapter 5\n\nWith Menelaus firmly entrenched in his position as High Priest, the fifth chapter discusses more matters of international politics.  Jason returns to stir up more trouble.  After hearing a rumor that Antiochus IV had perished in his second expedition to Egypt (part of the Sixth Syrian War), he attempts to overthrow Menelaus and retake his position as High Priest.  The text leaves unclear the degree of his success in this manner, although Menelaus is apparently forced to retreat.  However, Antiochus was not dead, and he attacks Jerusalem upon his return from Egypt, incorrectly inferring that a full-scale revolt against his rule had taken the town.  While this does cause Jason's downfall, it also leads to mass misery as Jews are robbed, enslaved, and killed in the resulting sack of the city.  Menelaus is restored to his position as High Priest, and he helps Antiochus rob the temple of 1800 talents and other offerings.  New officials are appointed to oversee the city, including an epistates named Philip.  Another occupying army of Mysians, led by a commander named Apollonius, instigates a slaughter of Jews on the Sabbath when they are abstaining from labor (and presumably combat) via trickery.  The chapter ends with a single sentence establishing that Judas Maccabeus and his initial band headed into the wilderness to avoid defilement and where Jewish law could be kept.\n  \nThe author is intent on showing that God is in control of history in his theology.  The attack on Jerusalem is explained as punishment for the Jerusalemites' own sins in 5:17-20, with Antiochus merely acting as an instrument for God's will.\n\nThe history found here largely matches what is described in 1 Maccabees, with two notable departures.  2 Maccabees offers a somewhat different motive to Antiochus, saying he was responding to Jason's coup; 1 Maccabees merely portrays him as an evil ruler who hated Jews.  Also, 1 Maccabees places the attack on Jerusalem slightly earlier, after Antiochus's first expedition to Egypt in 170/169 BCE rather than after the second expedition in 168 BCE.  By comparison, the historian Josephus implies he visited the city after both excursions, raiding the city in the first visit and the Temple in the second one.  Scholars differ on which version is the most reliable between 2 Maccabees, 1 Maccabees, and Josephus.  The detail that Antiochus personally entered the Jewish temple is corroborated in the non-Jewish history of Diodorus Siculus, suggesting that his profaning of the Temple was notable even to pagan audiences.\n\nOne historical possibility extracted from the text—against the intent of the author if so—is the hypothesis that another rebellion against Antiochus occurred, led not by Jason but rather by Jewish traditionalists.  The scholar Victor Tcherikover is generally credited with raising this idea, on the basis that a mere dispute over which official held the position of High Priest would be unlikely to lead to the havoc described.  Jason's conspiracy is described as \"coming to a shameful end\", but that end is not directly attributed to either Menelaus's allies or to Antiochus's invading army. While it is possible that this statement was merely out of chronological order as describing what would happen when Antiochus arrived to expel Jason, Tcherikover believes this third force was who defeated Jason.  If they existed at all, directly acknowledging these earlier, unsuccessful rebels would be unpalatable for the authors of both books of Maccabees, hence explaining the lack of direct reference to scholars who favor the theory.\n\nChapter 6\n\nThe situation continues to deteriorate in Chapter 6.  The king issues decrees forbidding the practice of traditional Judaism.  He dispatches Geron the Athenian to enforce this.  Geron adds the worship of Zeus to the Temple in Jerusalem in his role as Zeus Olympios (Zeus as King of the Gods), and to the Temple in Argarizin (that is, the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim) worship of Zeus Xenios (Zeus as patron of strangers and travelers).  The altar of the temple was defiled, and Jews were forced to celebrate the festival of Dionysus.  Horrific punishments are imposed on those who refuse.  Women who circumcise their sons are flung from the city walls, and two men caught observing the Sabbath are burnt to death.\n\nThe narrative goes into some detail about the martyr Eleazar, described as a prominent scribe of advanced age.  It seems a rule had been imposed for public performances of pork-eating, at least for prominent community members such as Eleazar.  The Jews enforcing this edict arrange for validly prepared kosher meat to be available for him to eat instead, so that he might appear to comply and avoid punishment, while actually maintaining Jewish law.  Eleazar declines the offer, however, saying he did not wish for the young to get the wrong impression and think he had abandoned the law.  He is tortured to death and dies, but as an exemplar of virtue.\n\n\"Geron the Athenian\" is only mentioned in the book of 2 Maccabees, and the phrasing is somewhat unclear; it could also be read as \"the elderly Athenaeus\".  While Athens was not part of the Seleucid Empire, Antiochus IV had spent part of his life in exile there, where he presumably made friends and allies.  As part of mainland Greece, it would have had legitimacy and prestige in the eyes of the ethnically Greek aristocrats of the Seleucid Empire, so sending an Athenian to oversee religious reforms is plausible.\n\nIn general, the historicity of the persecutions described in 2 Maccabees is uncontested.  Various other sources agree a persecution happened (e.g. 1 Maccabees, Daniel, the Testament of Moses, Josephus, Tacitus, Diodorus), and 2 Maccabees is considered a valuable source of details.  Antiochus banning circumcision and Sabbath observance makes sense, as these were the most well-known Jewish practices in pagan sources, and thus would have drawn his attention.  One claim on the nature of the persecution that is contested is in verse 7, which says that Jews were forced to worship Dionysus as well as celebrate the king's birthday monthly.  1 Maccabees does write that monthly sacrifices were required, but the suspicion is that the Egyptian epitomist is attempting to explain these sacrifices using customs in Ptolemaic Egypt that they were familiar with.  Monthly celebrations of the king's birthday were indeed a Ptolemaic custom, but are less well-attested in the wider Hellenistic world outside the mention here in 2 Maccabees; it is disputed whether this is merely due to evidence being lost or the epitomist erring. Similarly, while the cult of Dionysus was popular in Ptolemaic Egypt and among its rulers, the Seleucids considered Zeus their patron divinity.  Records of Seleucid worship of Dionysus are rare and minor.  To the extent Antiochus IV worshiped gods other than Zeus, Apollo seems to have been his favorite.  While it is possible that Geron the Athenian brought worship of Dionysus from Athens, where Dionysus was also popular, the simpler explanation is that the compiler was unfamiliar that Dionysus was substantially more popular locally in Egypt than in the Seleucid Empire.\n\nMartyrs are clearly revered by the author of 2 Maccabees, as befitting diaspora Judaism and later early Christianity where martyrdom was the highest display of devotion and loyalty possible.  This differs from 1 Maccabees, which is substantially more dismissive of martyrs, considering them part of the problem.  For 2 Maccabees, martyrs are a way of showing God that Jews are still loyal, and are ready to be reconciled with God.  Eleazar can be compared in role to Mattathias in 1 Maccabees: an elderly man who makes a public stand against the Seleucids, whether by dying to uphold God's law as in this book, or via killing those who stand against him as Mattathias does in 1 Maccabees.\n\nThe scene has been compared to the death of Socrates as both being exemplars of Hellenistic ideals of a noble and proper death.  Eleazar makes a final statement of his principles, as if he is a defendant at a trial and calling on God as a witness.\n\nChapter 7\n\nAntiochus IV personally oversees the torture of the woman and her seven sons, who had been arrested.  The group are whipped and told to violate Jewish law by eating pork, which they refuse to do.  A red-hot cauldron is prepared, and the first brother has his hands and feet cut off, before the rest of his body is thrown into the cauldron to be burned to death.  The second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth brother are similarly tortured; they are scalped and their limbs cut off before being thrown into the cauldron to burn to death, although not before they declare their devotion to God, declare that Antiochus and his descendants will suffer similarly, and say that God will resurrect them some day. The mother encourages her sons to continue to defy Antiochus during this.  The youngest is saved for last; Antiochus encourages the mother to convince him at least to comply, but the pair continue in their defiance.  Enraged, Antiochus treats the youngest worse than all the others, and the final son and the mother die.\n\nChapter 7, and the martyrdom of Eleazar that immediately precedes it, is easily the most famous section of 2 Maccabees, featuring in much later devotion, literature, art, and theology. It provided an archetype for both Jewish and Christian martyrs for centuries later who would stand by their beliefs even at the cost of their lives.  Secondary versions have appeared in works such as 4 Maccabees or independent renditions in the Jewish midrashim.  Eleazar said that he would not want to provide a poor example to the youth by appearing to comply with the decrees; this chapter is an immediate \"answer\" to this statement, showing the youth remaining firm in their Judaism despite the threat of awful torture.  The inclusion of the mother shows that martyrdom was available not merely to the young and old, but also both sexes.  It functions as a fulcrum of the dramatic structure of the book: while before God was punishing the Jews, after the resoluteness of the martyrs, the Jews are now reconciled with God, and God will switch to aiding the Jews in reclaiming their religion, as he had before in the story of Heliodorus and the Temple in Chapter 3.\n\nSimilar to the epitomist's comment in Chapter 6 that God is showing mercy to Jews by punishing them briefly and sharply for straying, the youngest son says as much directly: that \"if our living Lord is angry for a little while, to rebuke and discipline us, he will again be reconciled with his own servants.\" It again emphasizes the view of the epitomist that God controls the world and even the sufferings of Jews are his will, with Antiochus only serving as God's instrument.  The attitude of the epitomist toward Antiochus, while obviously hostile, is complex.  The epitomist describes Antiochus more as enraged and in thrall to his emotions, rather than being cold-blooded in his evil.  While the brothers threaten Antiochus with future tortures imposed by God as punishment for his impious actions, the youngest brother also expresses a wish that Antiochus will some day, after suffering his own afflictions imposed as divine punishment, confess that the Jewish god alone is God.\n\nThe chapter is one of the earliest pieces of Jewish literature to directly suggest a future resurrection of righteous individuals.  The Book of Isaiah discussed the resurrection of the \"suffering servant\" before and was an influential precursor, although this was often taken as a reference to the resurrection of the nation of Israel as an entity at the time.  2 Maccabees as well as the Book of Daniel reframe resurrection on a more personal level: the righteous, even if they suffer during the persecution, will be brought back by God, and their unjust deaths reversed.  This was likely a way to update the Deuteronomist view of history, which suggested the righteous would be rewarded and the wicked punished; a future resurrection would ensure that the righteous would eventually be properly justified, even if delayed.\n\nA less important and possibly unintended theological issue is that the mother tells her remaining son that God did not make the heavens and the earth \"out of things that existed\".  In context, the intent is to show that all life comes from and returns to God; some later Christian theologians cited the passage as backing for the doctrine of creatio ex nihilo, the stance that God created the entire universe.\n\nWhile the basic historicity of martyrs being killed during the persecution is uncontested, the details of the story are not considered likely to be particularly accurate.  Antiochus probably did not personally oversee tortures nor engage in conversation with those about to be tortured, and even if he had, then the dialogue recorded was surely improved to be more eloquent, as was common with histories of the era that would routinely invent appropriate dialogue for a scene.  Having the king feature directly rather than some lackey executing the king's will is typical of such stories as well, to better emphasize his culpability.  The details may be a callback to , which mentions the death of a woman who bore seven children.\n\nChapter 8\n\nThis is the first chapter in the book that describes the military struggle against the Seleucids led by Judas Maccabeus.  Judas forms an army out of hatred of evil, backed by the will of God.  Philip, the Seleucid governor of Jerusalem, asks for reinforcements to defeat Judas's army.  Seleucid generals Nicanor and Gorgias respond and lead an expedition to attack Judea.  They also seek to enslave Jews, sell them, and use the funds to pay off the debt owed to the Romans (presumably a reference to the tribute required by the Treaty of Apamea).  Before the battle with Nicanor, Judas gives a speech where he cites other cases of God enabling smaller forces to triumph over larger ones.  He cites a battle in the era of Sennacherib where 185,000 soldiers fell, along with a story of a battle in Babylonia against Galatians where 6,000 soldiers defeated 120,000 Galatians, each soldier killing 20 people.  Judas and his brothers form into four divisions and cut down 9,000 Seleucid soldiers during the battle (presumably a reference to the Battle of Emmaus in 165 BCE).  The only reason the rout is not more complete is that it is the day before the Sabbath, and the Jews do not wish to continue their pursuit into the day of rest.  They ironically take treasure from those who had come to enslave Jews for money, and distribute the first portion as charity to the mistreated, widows, and orphans before splitting the rest among themselves.  Nicanor retreats to Antioch, humiliated.\n\nThe focus of the book differs from the same events related in 1 Maccabees; it relegates the details of the fighting to a few short verses, and instead fills out the text with more religious matters, such as a speech citing biblical precedent, a reading of the Torah prior to battle, and the distribution of charity after the battle.  It also notably includes no mention of Mattathias, the father of Judas.  1 Maccabees was interested in building up the Hasmonean dynasty, which makes Mattathias important as its patriarch; 2 Maccabees has little interest in dynastic politics and does not mention him at all.  The author smooths over the fact that Judas was probably fighting fellow Jews early in the revolt by not being clear on who exactly he was attacking or what towns he was setting fire to.  1 Maccabees calls the foes Judas fought early \"sinners\", \"lawless\", and \"impious\", suggesting he was fighting hostile Jews considered insufficiently traditionalist to the Maccabees.  Also, 2 Maccabees places the focus on Nicanor at the Battle of Emmaus; Nicanor plays a major role as an antagonist throughout 2 Maccabees.  1 Maccabees discusses the role of Gorgias more for this battle.  The claim of 9,000 soldiers being defeated is presumed to be an exaggeration, a technique that the author repeatedly uses throughout the military history portion of the story, which routinely feature much larger enemy casualty counts than 1 Maccabees. Ancient authors of all nationalities routinely exaggerated the size of enemy armies in their work for rhetorical effect.\n\nThe author directly shows God answering the prayer of the mother and her seven sons in 7:38, writing that as they had hoped, God's anger at the Jews has turned to mercy (8:5).  With God's aid, Judas will defeat all in his path no matter the odds.\n\nA person named Ptolemy is mentioned in verse 8 as the governor of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, probably the same person as Ptolemy Macron mentioned in 10:12-13.  There was also a \"Ptolemy son of Dorymenes\" mentioned in 4:45 and 1 Maccabees 3:38; it is disputed whether those are different names for the same person or two separate people.\n\nJudas mentions earlier battles in his speech; the allusion to Sennacherib is a reference to the Assyrian siege of Jerusalem, mentioned in both 2 Kings 19 and Isaiah 37.  It is unknown what battle is being referred to in Judas's speech about an earlier fight against Galatians in Babylonia, if there is any historical precedent for it at all.  Galatians were concentrated in Asia Minor (modern Anatolia), so it is not obvious what they would have been doing in Babylonia—serving as mercenaries? Part of a past Seleucid civil war?  Galatians had a reputation as hardy fighters in the era, so defeating them (by some Jewish army that had also ended up in Babylonia?  By noble Gentiles?) would have been an impressive feat, even if the claim of precisely 20 enemies killed by each soldier seems more numerological than historical.\n\nVerses 30-33 are a story of how soldiers under Timothy and Bacchides were killed, along with Timothy's phylarch (literally \"tribal leader\", although perhaps meaning more a subcommander here). Timothy is forced into a humiliating retreat similar to Nicanor's retreat.  This is before Timothy has been introduced into the narrative; it seems to have been placed here because of the similar division of spoils and weapons as to the story of Emmaus, or because the author saw Timothy's fate as similar to Nicanor and a useful way to emphasize the point.  It is probably a \"flash-forward\" to the events described in Chapter 12 and should not be taken as happening directly after Emmaus, despite the mention in Chapter 9.  It is contested by scholars whether there is one Timothy or two.  Bezalel Bar-Kochva argues there is just a single Timothy; Jonathan Goldstein argues that the Timothy in Chapter 8 and 12 is one person, while the one slain at Gazara in Chapter 10 is separate; Robert Doran argues there are two Timothys in the text of 2 Maccabees but does not opine on which one is referred to by Chapter 8.\n\nA person named Bacchides is mentioned as working with Timothy.  This was a reasonably common name in the era, so it is unclear if this Bacchides is the same Bacchides mentioned in 1 Maccabees.\n\nChapter 9\n\nThe ninth chapter discusses the death of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, gleefully detailing his defeats, illness, and suffering as a form of divine punishment.  He is defeated by a Persian mob while attempting to rob another temple in Persepolis and forced into a shameful retreat.  While in Ecbatana, Antiochus hears the bad news of Nicanor's defeat at Emmaus, and resolves to punish the Jews.  He is struck by divine disease of the entrails after blaspheming a threat to turn Jerusalem into a vast Jewish cemetery.  Further calamities befall him: he falls out of a chariot and suffers massive injuries; worms crawl out of his eyes; and his flesh disintegrates while he is still alive, creating an awful stench.  Antiochus repents and vows to set Jerusalem free, raise the Jews to the status of Greeks, restore the plundered treasures of the Temple, and to become a Jew himself.  He writes a letter to the Jews guaranteeing their rights and privileges.  He then dies, in a foreign land amid the mountains.  His assistant Philip takes the body back to Syria, but then flees to Ptolemaic Egypt.\n\nThe basic historicity of what is described is plausible enough: that Antiochus went on a campaign in the east, was involved in the plunder of a temple, became sick, and died.  Non-Jewish sources confirm these elements.  Additionally, historians generally agree with the timing implied in 2 Maccabees of Antiochus's death occurring before the cleansing of the temple, which archaeological evidence seems to support, against the chronology given in 1 Maccabees of this happening afterward.  The specific details and quotes are generally assumed to be literary rather than historical, however.  The section where Antiochus writes a deathbed epistle granting rights to the Jews is considered very unlikely to be historical, as it is exactly what Jews of the era would most want to fabricate—a document declaring that their rights and privileges were protected by royal decree.  The reference to Persepolis may also be muddled or in error, as Greek sources do not connect Persepolis with the expedition.  Persepolis had been looted and mostly destroyed by Alexander the Great centuries earlier, leading to the question of if there was anything still worth taking in the ruins.  Additionally, Persepolis is hundreds of kilometers away from Elymais, where Antiochus is usually thought to have done his looting.  It may have been the author choosing a famous Persian city if he knew Antiochus was in Persia without further details, or a scribal error where \"Persis\" was misread as a city rather than a region.  Ecbatana, the capital of Media, is closer to Elymais, though, and thus considered more likely to be historical.\n\nThe genre of detailing the sorrows and demises of villains who thought they could defy God would continue in later works, with Chapter 9 one of the earliest (or even first) examples.  De mortibus persecutorum is a famous Christian example of the genre from the 4th century.  Having worms afflict an evil ruler became a common motif in the genre among writers of all religions: Sulla (by a pagan source, Plutarch), Queen Pheretima of Cyrene (by a pagan source, Herodotus, but perhaps known to Jason of Cyrene), Herod the Great (by a Jewish source, Josephus), Herod Agrippa (by a Christian source, the Book of Acts), and others are all described as suffering from worms on their way to a miserable end.  Among precedents in Hebrew scripture, Isaiah 14 mentions that the villainous King of Babylon will be infested by worms, albeit after he is already dead.  The reference to a disease of the entrails may be a reference to King Jehoram of Judah, another evil tyrant struck by divine disease, although it may also be a roundabout reference to the martyrs in Chapter 7—that forcing Jews to eat pork would corrupt their entrails, so it is fair for Antiochus's own entrails to be corrupted.\n\nJonathan Goldstein argues that the epitomist adjusted the account to attempt to support the Book of Daniel's prophecy where he could.  The Book of Daniel describes the King of the North's end in 11:44-45: \"...he shall go out with great fury to bring ruin and complete destruction to many. He shall pitch his palatial tents between the sea and the beautiful holy mountain. Yet he shall come to his end, with no one to help him.\"  The epitomist depicts Antiochus as a person in thrall to his emotions, with a similar \"great fury\" in 9:4, and that the stench of his decaying flesh had repelled even his retainers, leaving him alone.  Additionally, Antiochus's acknowledgment of the power of God mirrors Daniel's depictions of various kings, even antagonistic ones, being ultimately forced to admit God's superior sovereignty.\n\nAntiochus's death fulfills the prediction made by the youngest brother of the martyrs in 7:35-37, that Antiochus would suffer just punishment for his arrogance, and that trials and plagues would make him confess the power of the Jewish God.\n\nChapter 10\n\nChapter 10 opens with the purification of the Temple by Judas Maccabeus after he takes control of Jerusalem.  This would be the origin of what is now called the festival of Hanukkah, an eight-day celebration of the reclamation of the Temple.  Returning to Seleucid politics, Antiochus's young son Antiochus V Eupator is now king, and Lysias is appointed regent.  Governor Ptolemy Macron (a former Ptolemaic official who defected and handed over Cyprus to the Seleucids in the Sixth Syrian War) tries to mend relationships with the Jews, but he is accused and undermined by the king's philoi (\"friends\"), and forced to commit suicide. He is replaced by Gorgias, who is hostile to the Jews, and hires mercenaries to attack them.  The Jews also struggle with the Idumaeans to the south.  Judas leads an expedition to attack them and defeats them, killing over 20,000 Idumeans.  The struggle is interrupted by some Jewish commanders who take payments to allow some Idumeans to escape; when Judas discovers this, he orders the Jews executed as traitors, then conquers two towers held by the Idumeans and kills another 20,000 of them.  Judas then fights a commander named Timothy (possibly Timothy of Ammon?) who invades Judea, backed by foreign mercenaries.  Judas's force defeats him in battle, aided by five heavenly cavalrymen with golden horse bridles.  20,500 enemy soldiers and 600 cavalrymen are slain.  Timothy retreats to the stronghold of Gazara (Gezer?).  Judas's army besieges Gazara.  After five days, some Jewish youths distract the defenders with a direct assault, which allows other soldiers to climb the walls, set fire to the towers, and open the gate for a Jewish assault.  Timothy is found hiding and is slain, as well as two commanders named Chaereas and Apollophanes.  The Jews sing hymns of gratitude to God for granting them the victory.\n\nThe chapter is vague in its chronology and does not directly specify dates for the events it describes.  Antiochus IV Epiphanes died in late 164 BCE.  When exactly the battles described afterward occurred is unclear, although they seem likely to be part of the Maccabee campaigns of 163 BCE.  Another chronology issue is that verses 2-3 seem to indicate that sacrifices had stopped at the temple for a period of two years before Judas reinstated them.  If that is what is meant, it goes against 1 Maccabees and Josephus, which seem to indicate that sacrifices were paused for a period of three or three and a half years.\n\nThe somewhat vague account of the re-lighting of the temple fire is likely due to Jewish belief and expectation that the altar fire would be somehow blessed, and should ideally come directly from God himself.  Leviticus 10 describes Nadab and Abihu being incinerated by God for improperly lighting fire for a sacrifice as an example of how serious this was.  The passage is somewhat unclear, with a literal reading being of \"igniting rocks\", but seems to hint at sparks flying from stones to re-light the fire to add the expected miraculous element.  The second letter to the Jews of Egypt in Chapter 2 expands on the theology of this re-lighting.\n\nThe chapter includes an unusual amount of military history for the book, discussing battles and troop movements.  However, as per the habit of the epitomist, these accounts are bracketed with prayers, and there is a divine intervention.  As throughout the volume, the casualty counts are considered wildly exaggerated.  It is unclear what exact role Gorgias played in the struggle; 1 Maccabees places him in the coastal Greek towns of the time, rather than Idumea.  The mention of the hated Gorgias could be part of the diasporan author's tendency to explain Jewish struggles with Gentiles as the result of malicious leaders.  The Timothy here is described as leading an invasion of Judea, and Gezer is indeed in western Judea near the coastal plain.  Such an invasion is not described in any other source, notably not appearing in 1 Maccabees which is eager to celebrate Judas's victories.  1 Maccabees does chronicle a campaign against a commander named Timothy in Ammon, including a battle at a fortress named Jazer (albeit not one where Timothy is described as dying).  Several scholars believe that this story is in fact a distorted retelling of the campaign in Ammon: either the diasporan author did not recognize Jazer and replaced it with Gezer, a translation error in moving from Hebrew to Greek caused similar confusion, or that he intentionally moved the Maccabee invasion of Ammon into a more defensive and dramatic defense of Judea against an invasion.  It is also possible that both accounts are correct, and the issue is more of 2 Maccabees describing events out-of-order.  A similar issue is raised with the fact that Timothy is described as dying, despite appearing in Chapter 12; whether this is out-of-order sequencing of events, two separate Timothys, or an outright error is not easily resolved.\n\nAmong scholars who argue that the book of 2 Maccabees was written as a response to 1 Maccabees or by a Pharisee enemy of the Hasmonean dynasty, the story in Idumea, where Simon Thassi's men take an astronomical bribe (70,000 drachmas was gigantic in the era), Judas returns, executes the leaders that took the bribe, then conquers the towers himself, is cited as evidence.  Other scholars disagree that this was meant as an implicit criticism of Simon (and by extension, his descendants that ruled the Hasmonean kingdom) and just see the passage as glorifying Judas.  Regardless of whether the account was intended to smear Simon or not, it is consistent with the epitomist's overall view of Judas as an unstoppable commander.  His setbacks are always due to malfeasance from others.\n\nChapter 11\n\nChapter 11 describes an expedition to Judea led by the regent Lysias, the guardian of young king Antiochus V.  Lysias leads an army of 80,000 men, all of his cavalry, and 80 war elephants to restore Seleucid control of Jerusalem.  Judas and the Jews pray to God for deliverance and for him to send an angel to defend Israel.  A mysterious horseman in white garments and golden weapons appears near Jerusalem to aid Judas's army.  The Battle of Beth-Zur results; the Maccabees and their heavenly ally win a resounding victory, killing 11,000 soldiers and 1,600 cavalrymen.  Lysias and his expedition are forced to shamefully retreat.  Lysias, not being a fool, realizes that the Hebrews are invincible, and negotiates to end hostilities.   Several documents are then provided of negotiations conducted by the Jews in this period after Lysias's defeat.  They show promises to end Antiochus IV's decrees forbidding traditional Jewish practices and the offer of a conditional amnesty.  The final document is of negotiations with the Roman Republic for a possible alliance.\n\nChapter 11 describes an expedition by Lysias to Judea it after the cleansing of the Temple.  It is possibly the same expedition that is described in Chapter 13.  In contrast, 1 Maccabees includes two separate expeditions by Lysias that both stop by Beth-Zur, but one before the cleansing of the Temple in 164 BCE, and the other is after the cleansing of the Temple in 162 BCE.  Whether the epitomist is claiming there was only one expedition, or if he is claiming that there were two expeditions that both took place after the cleansing of the Temple, there is out-of-order sequencing going on where this passage describes the pre-cleansing campaign despite being placed later, or the epitomist simply made mistakes and conflated separate events across both campaigns into one narrative, is disputed.  The mention of 80 war elephants matches what Josephus said of Lysias's second expedition, suggesting that this account is perhaps mostly based on the second expedition.  However, several of the later documents make more sense for happening after the first expedition.\n\nAs usual, the depiction of the battle at Beth-Zur is not given much credence, and the troop numbers are wildly exaggerated—feeding such a gigantic group would have been impossible.  Daniel R. Schwartz suggests that Chapters 10 and 11 might have come from some secondary source other than Jason of Cyrene's history, explaining why they seemingly duplicate material seen elsewhere.\n\nThe letters are considered to be genuine and among the most useful parts of 2 Maccabees to historians.  They match the style of what such negotiations would be, including phrases seen by other Hellenistic kings in their correspondences.  They also include several \"admissions against interest\" that suggest the epitomist included even aspects that might be seen as embarrassing to his message.  For example, the third document credits  Menelaus with also appealing for a conditional amnesty.  As the epitomist clearly thinks of Menelaus as an evil villain, the most likely reason to include a passage of even Menelaus pleading for the Jews would presumably be out of respect for accuracy.  The fourth document is also one of the earliest pieces of evidence for Roman intervention in Seleucid affairs.  The historian Polybius describes in his Histories how the Roman Senate sought to make the Seleucid government weak and compliant, and Rome encouraging splinter groups with promises fits what is known of Roman foreign policy in the period.\n\nThe four documents in this chapter do not appear to be in chronological order.  The first, third, and fourth documents are dated to 148 SE, equivalent to Fall 165 BCE–Fall 164 BCE.  The months, however, have been contested as possibly confusion between the Attic calendar months and the Ancient Macedonian calendar months.  Notably, the first document references an otherwise unknown month of \"Dios Corinthos\" (a renamed month of Dios?), and the third and fourth document have identical dates, suggesting the possibility of an early scribal error by a copyist of the document incorrectly writing the same date twice.  The second document is undated but is on Antiochus V's behalf, suggesting a date of 163–161 BCE.  Various reconstructions of the dates have been made.\n\nChapter 12\n\nChapter 12 discusses struggles between the Jews and their neighbors in the greater Palestine region.  The coastal city of Joppa lures local Jews onto boats, then sink them, killing 200 people.  Judas infiltrates the city at night, sets fire to the port and its boats, and kills some locals to take revenge for the atrocity.  He then burns the boats at Jamnia too as a reprisal for a similar anti-Jewish incident.  Judas fights a commander named Timothy who has an army of Arabs (Nabateans).  After defeating them, Judas makes an informal treaty with the Arabs for them to provide cattle.  Judas next attacks the city of Caspin (modern Haspin?).  With God's aid, he takes the city and slaughters the inhabitants.  Judas next sets out for lands controlled by the Tobiad Jews in Ammon.  Timothy's local fortresses are conquered by Judas's men.  Timothy himself encamps at the city Karnion with a gigantic army of 120,000 infantry and 2,500 cavalry; however, God's power makes them flee and stumble into each other, wounding themselves with their own swords.  Judas's forces kill 30,000 fleeing soldiers of Timothy, and Timothy is himself captured.  However, he is paroled in exchange for promises to release Jewish hostages.  After capturing Karnion, Judas's forces cut down 25,000 corpses at the Temple of Atergatis (a Syrian version of the goddess Astarte, and a loose analogue to Artemis in Hellenistic culture), presumably a reference to fleeing civilians killed while seeking refuge in the temple.  Judas then attacks the city of Ephron, takes it, and kills 25,000 inhabitants.  He next moves to Scythopolis, but the Jews there testify that they are well-treated by the inhabitants.  Judas's men thank them and peaceably proceed back to Jerusalem in time for the Festival of Weeks, also known as Pentecost in Greek.\n\nAfter the festival is finished, the Maccabees fight Gorgias in Idumea, who has an army of 3,000 soldiers and 400 cavalry.  While the Maccabees eventually win thanks to Judas's prayer and intervention, some of their soldiers die in the fight.  The Maccabees first ritually purify themselves after coming into contact with dead bodies.  Upon investigation, it is found that all of the dead soldiers had forbidden idols looted from Jamnia in their tunics (rather than destroying them as they should have), and this was the reason God had allowed them to fall.  Judas takes up a sin offering for the fallen from his men of around 2,000 silver drachmas, which is donated in Jerusalem.  The chapter closes by stating that prayers for the dead are still useful due to the coming resurrection.\n\nThe narrative mostly mirrors the version of these events told in 1 Maccabees 5.  There are a few differences, however.  The raids on Joppa and Jamnia are unique to this version, and not considered particularly historically plausible as they were fortified towns.  Some sort of Jewish pogrom is plausible, but a raid that somehow penetrated the port without also conquering the town is considered unlikely.  They do, however, fit the epitomist's diasporan Jewish perspective of how the Jews only wanted peace, and only engaged outside their territory out of necessity to punish evil and perfidy.  This reciprocity is emphasized by the differing treatment Judas gives to the cities of Caspin and Ephron (which are destroyed) against the city of Scythopolis and the Arabs (which are allowed to continue on in peace).  Another notable difference was the explanation for why some Jewish soldiers died in the fighting in Idumea.  For the epitomist, it was because of theological impropriety and idols; for the author of 1 Maccabees, it was that they were not led by Hasmoneans.  This book also has Judas involved in the fight against Gorgias from the start, while in 1 Maccabees it was managed by others at first.  This account also omits the story of Simon's campaign in western Galilee.\n\nOne minor shift in the narrative suggested by Daniel Schwartz and others is that the story in verses 17-19 of visiting the land of the Tobiads in Ammon would make more sense to chronologically come in between verses 1-9 (fighting in coastal cities) and verses 10-12 (a brief battle and then peace with some Arabs), which makes the geography of the travels line up better.  Robert Doran suggests that the epitomist might have rearranged the stories to better provide moral parallels; Bezalel Bar-Kochva, more skeptically, proposes that the epitomist was simply in error and unreliable due to their unfamiliarity with the geography of the region.\n\nA commander named Timothy appears again in this chapter; per the earlier chapters, scholars disagree on whether this Timothy should be identified as the same as all, some, or none of the other references to a Seleucid official named Timothy.\n\nThe insistence on the importance of the resurrection suggests that the matter may have been a relevant theological dispute in the era.  According to both Josephus and Acts 23, Sadducees denied resurrection, while Pharisees supported it.  The passages discussing the resurrection here, as well as in the martyrs, has caused some scholars to see 2 Maccabees as a Pharisaic work, or at least influenced by them; other scholars doubt this, however, and suggest that Jewish belief in the resurrection was wider than just the Pharisees.\n\nThe Catholic practice of prayers for the dead cites the story as scriptural backing.  It seems that a theological difference in the era was whether the fates of the dead were entirely sealed or could be modified after their death; 2 Maccabees, as well as 1 Corinthians 15 and The Passion of Saints Perpetua and Felicity, believe they can be, while the Book of Enoch and the Gospel of Luke suggest that they cannot be.  More controversially, Judas's sin offering would be cited as an example of the efficacy of monetary indulgences paid to the Catholic Church in the 15th and 16th centuries.  The practice of selling indulgences, among other factors, provoked Martin Luther and other reformers into the Protestant Reformation.  Luther decried the practice and sought to banish 2 Maccabees, and other deuterocanonical works, into non-canonical Apocrypha.\n\nChapter 13\n\nHigh Priest Menelaus has worn out Lysias's patience and earned the condemnation of God. Lysias and Eupator arrange for his execution at Beroea (modern Aleppo) by tipping him into a tower filled with ashes, such that his body will not find rest in the earth.  Lysias launches an expedition in Judea on behalf of the young King Antiochus V Eupator, backed by a gigantic force of 110,000 infantry, 5,300 cavalry, 22 war elephants, and 300 scythed chariots.  Camping near Modein, Judas leads a \"picked force\" on a daring early morning raid, attacking and killing 2,000 men of the Seleucid force, as well as an elephant and rider, before retreating.  Lysias attacks more carefully, this time near Beth-Zur, and is forced to retreat after several inconclusive battles.  A Jewish traitor named Rhodocus is exposed as a spy and imprisoned.  Lysias receives word that Philip, a political rival back in the capital Antioch, has disavowed Lysias's authority and revolted.  He hurriedly moves to make peace with the Jews so that he can return and address the problem, and gives the temple its proper honor.  A new governor is appointed over the region; the citizens of Ptolemais are deeply unhappy with the treaty, but Lysias convinces them the treaty is for the best before returning to Antioch.\n\nThe story of Menelaus's execution is possibly influenced by the Book of Esther, where Haman prepares a gallows 50 cubits high, the same height as the tower of ashes.  Verse 4 calls God the \"King of Kings\", a term rare in Hellenistic Judaism, but common in Persian-era stories (\"Shahanshah\") such as Esther.  Additionally, Esther describes three days of fasting, as does verse 12.  The style of execution described is known to be used by Persian kings as well.  Menelaus being killed without a burial place in the ground would have been considered a terrible fate to both Jewish and Hellenistic audiences of the era.  It was a punishment inflicted on those who committed temple robbery and treason.\n\nThe introduction to the chapter suggests that Antiochus V Eupator would personally be leading the expedition and that \"each\" of Lysias and Eupator had a Greek force.  As Eupator was only nine years old, it is generally considered that this passage was somehow garbled, whether via a scribal error, miswriting, or the epitomist exaggerating for impact.  Later passages do not mention Eupator being personally present.\n\nLysias's expedition to Beth-Zur is once again mentioned, dated to 149 SE (Fall 164–Fall 163 BCE).  The narrative does not make clear whether it is describing the same expedition as in Chapter 11 that also went to Beth-Zur, which is curious, as the book features good cross-referencing to earlier events in other places.  Nevertheless, the epitomist does not write \"again\" or \"despite his previous failure\" or the like.  This causes most scholars to believe that Chapter 11 and Chapter 13 are two separate accounts of what the epitomist considered the same campaign.  The general assessment is to treat the account here as of events from the second expedition of Lysias described in 1 Maccabees Chapter 6.  However, there are major differences between these accounts.  No motive is given for the campaign here; according to 1 Maccabees, the Seleucids were trying to relieve a Maccabee siege of the Acra in Jerusalem.  The Battle of Beth Zechariah, a Jewish defeat, is not mentioned by the epitomist; he does mention an incident involving killing a war elephant in a raid, possibly a distorted reference to Judas's brother Eleazar attacking an elephant at Beth Zechariah.  Another disparity is that 1 Maccabees dates the second campaign to 150 SE, or 163/162 BCE.  The epitomist describes the return of the Seleucid forces from Judea as due to political concerns with Philip rather than a military defeat, suggesting he knew about the Seleucid success but did not wish to bring it up; in 1 Maccabees, the Seleucids do retake Jerusalem and tear down the Temple wall, while this account implies the Seleucids never got that far.  The mention of Modein is also considered unreliable; it is a famous location as where the Hasmoneans were living at the start of the revolt, but it is on the northwestern side of Jerusalem, while the rest of the account as well as 1 Maccabees suggests that the Seleucids approached from the southern route.  One theory about the staccato nature of this chapter's version of the campaign is that if the epitomist or later editor acquired some separate source which became Chapter 10 and 11, he chopped out parts he considered duplicative from Jason of Cyrene's work, hence the story of the campaign in Chapter 13 seeming incomplete.\n\nJust as in Chapter 11, an implausibly large Seleucid army is reported, with the 80,000 there growing to 110,000 infantry here (or even 220,000 if \"each\" is interpreted as there being two such armies!).  Scholars of Hellenistic armies such as Israel Shatzman consider deploying, managing, and feeding such a vast army \"impossible\".  The number of war elephants has shrunk to a more reasonable amount, with 22 compared to the 32 in 1 Maccabees 6 or the 80 mentioned in Chapter 11 and Josephus.  Polybius reports that the Seleucids had 40 war elephants in a military parade at Daphne in 165 BCE.  Bezalel Bar-Kochva speculates this was all they had, and that further around half were sent east to Babylonia and Persia, which would indeed leave around 20 war elephants for the Western half of the Empire.  The mention of scythed chariots is also considered unreliable; if the Seleucids even still maintained any and had brought them, they would probably not have been taken into Judea's hilly interior, as they were a weapon that only functioned on flat lowlands such as the coast where they could get to a high enough speed.\n\nThe story of Rhodocus the traitor and the battles around Beth-Zur is extremely abbreviated and murky.  Given its placement immediately after a statement that Judas sent \"whatever was necessary\" (supplies?) to Beth-Zur, perhaps Rhodocus was passing information on supply routes into Beth-Zur to the Seleucids.  However, the narrative describes the Seleucids in short succession making a deal, attacking, being ultimately repulsed from Beth-Zur, then making a new deal with Judas, leaving unclear the impact of Rhodocus's treachery—allowing the Seleucids to cut supply lines, perhaps?  1 Maccabees seems to indicate that in the second campaign, the Seleucids did indeed successfully occupy Beth-Zur, rather than the account here.  The series of battles around Beth-Zur, the attack on Judas's forces, and a new treaty between the king and the Jews are compressed into a mere 6 verses.   Whether the epitomist was simply very uninterested in questions of provisions and cut the account down to a stub, or the epitomist was intentionally clouding what was an overall Jewish defeat by only including positive aspects, is disputed.\n\nThe story of Philip's rebellion is considered a useful secondary account, but has some issues and contradictions with other sources.  Chapter 9 reported that he had already gone into exile in Egypt, but that is more likely to be a case of out-of-order sequencing.  According to 1 Maccabees, Philip had claimed that Antiochus IV Epiphanes had appointed him regent and successor while on his campaign in the East.  If the 1 Maccabees account is trusted, it is unlikely that Philip would have been actually appointed to a position by Lysias before his rebellion; rather, it is describing Philip returning to Syria and attempting to rally support for his claim over Lysias's.\n\nThe account of Hegemonides being appointed new governor of Coele-Syria has some backing archaeological evidence of such a person indeed being active at the time.  An inscription found in Dyme in Greece records a Hegemonides, son of Zephyros making a dedication to Antiochus Epiphanes; an inscription in Laodicea in Syria honors a Hegemonides of Dyne.  The city of Ptolemais, which apparently resisted the more Jewish-friendly policy of Hegemonides, is described in 1 Maccabees 5 as being known for their hostility to Jews.\n\nChapter 14\n\nChapter 14 largely focuses on the rise of High Priest Alcimus, a new villain.  In the capital of Antioch, Lysias and Antiochus V are overthrown by Demetrius I.  In the year 151 SE (equivalent to Fall 162 – Fall 161 BCE), Alcimus arrives to criticize Judas Maccabeus and to petition to be installed as High Priest.  Demetrius agrees.  Alcimus is appointed High Priest, while Nicanor is given the governorship of Judea.  While there is a brief clash at Dessau between Simon's forces and Nicanor's army where Nicanor wins, he is hesitant to immediately resort to renewed war.  He sets out entreaties to Judas and the two meet.  Surprisingly, the two become friends, and the situation calms in Jerusalem.  Judas is appointed Nicanor's deputy as part of the peace deal, marries, and enjoys life.  Alcimus is upset with this turn of events, and complains to King Demetrius.  Demetrius sends Nicanor new orders to arrest Judas.  Judas realizes something is wrong and begins avoiding Nicanor.  Nicanor goes to the Temple and demands that the priests there arrange for Judas to be handed over, lest he level the Temple and replace it with one to Dionysus.  The priests pray to God to protect the Temple in response.  Nicanor orders the arrest of Razis, a respected elder of Jerusalem who has a good reputation.  Razis attempts to commit suicide rather than be captured, but misaims his sword, and only wounds himself.  He flings himself off the tower he is in, lands amidst the mob of soldiers, runs on top of a large rock while bleeding out, and takes his own innards out of his wound to throw at Nicanor's soldiers to ensure his death.\n\nThe opening of the chapter describes Demetrius arriving in Tripolis with a \"strong force and fleet\".  Presumably the author wanted to build up Demetrius as a threat equivalent of Antiochus IV, but other sources including 1 Maccabees indicate he arrived with just a few close followers.  Polybius, who personally knew Demetrius and was directly involved in the plot to smuggle him back to the Seleucid Empire, reports he chartered a normal, commercial ship to better lay low, hardly a fleet.\n\nThe chapter calls Alcimus a \"former\" high priest and writes he needed Demetrius's approval to establish his authority.  This implies that Alcimus had been appointed high priest after Menelaus's execution, perhaps on some sort of temporary basis, by Lysias and Eupator.  However, he apparently needed to get confirmation to stay in his role from the new king.  The chapter is also vague on how exactly Alcimus \"defiled himself\" earlier.  Various scholars, noting how Alcimus was apparently able to command the loyalty of many Jews and the lack of any apparent Hellenizing changes to Jewish worship during his tenure, doubt the veracity of this statement.  While Alcimus clearly did become a Seleucid collaborator, it would make more sense for the government to have picked a Jew in good standing for the role; conversely, Maccabee-friendly sources would have wanted to discredit Alcimus to make his decision to serve the government as the choice of someone already untrustworthy and corrupt.\n\nThe installation of Alcimus and Nicanor's governorship are also covered in 1 Maccabees Chapter 7, although there are differences.  2 Maccabees is careful to spread the blame at the capital for the selection of Alcimus rather than accuse the king too directly, suggesting the king was misled by bad advice.  The location of Dessau (or Caphar-Dessau) is unknown, nor is the battle there by Simon's forces described in 1 Maccabees.  Judas is described here by Alcimus as the leader of the Asidaioi (or, if Hebraized, Hasideans), but the usage of the term seems to differ from how 1 Maccabees uses it.  1 Maccabees uses the term to describe a group of faithful Jews who did not follow Judas and were betrayed by Alcimus; 2 Maccabees seems to use the term to describe faithful or traditionalist Jews in general, from the root Hebrew/Aramic hysd, seen in hasidim (pious).  Both this account and 1 Maccabees agree that Alcimus helped re-ignite hostilities after a truce. The versions of the story of Nicanor and Judas in 1 Maccabees and 2 Maccabees vary over the motives involved in a way that is consistent with the stance the authors respectively held.  1 Maccabees insists that the lull in relations was merely a ruse from the start, and that non-Jews cannot be trusted; 2 Maccabees, as a diaspora work, is willing to suggest peaceful coexistence and friendship with Gentiles was possible until a villain in Alcimus disrupted it.  2 Maccabees also depicts some of its villains as neutral at first who then choose to become evil before being punished by God; both Antiochus IV and Nicanor follow such a story arc.  This account omits the expeditions of Bacchides, who served as Alcimus's escort in 1 Maccabees.  Presumably this is because the epitomist found the overall success of Bacchides embarrassing and against the theme of the work; according to 1 Maccabees, Bacchides' first expedition was uncontested, and he later killed Judas at Elasa.\n\nThe threat of dedicating a new temple to Dionysus at the site of the Second Temple has the same issue as in Chapter 5; Dionysus was far more popular in Egypt than Syria, and was potentially a case of an Egyptian writer inventing dialogue that fit Egyptian culture closer than Seleucid culture.\n\nThe chapter sets up a contrast between Alcimus, who \"defiled himself\" during times of strife, and Razis, who remained \"steadfast\" during the earlier period and is now willing to gruesomely martyr himself rather than submit.  Razis is described as an \"elder\"; this presumably means that he was a member of the gerusia or governing council, not that he was particularly old.  The overall account is rather abrupt without much setup, possibly due to the epitomist omitting text as part of the abridgment; it does not explain if Nicanor had a more specific reason than distaste for the Jews to order the arrest Razis, if Razis knew of Judas's location, why 500 men were necessary, or how Razis ended up in a fortified tower.  His extended death scene was possibly influenced by the death of Menoeceus, who is described as having a similar fate of a failed sword stroke followed by throwing himself into the enemy in Euripides' Phoenician Women.  Theologically, the epitomist clearly approves of Razis's suicide.  This stance was not uncommon in Judaism, which allowed suicide in certain dire situations, and certain branches of early Christianity; the 4th-5th century Donatists are reported as being famous for resorting to suicide rather than dishonor.  However, the writer's endorsement of Razis's action was awkward in the Catholic Church, which both considered the book inspired but also sharply disapproved of direct suicide.\n\nChapter 15\n\nNicanor's defeat\n\nWith the treaty in tatters, Nicanor moves out of Jerusalem toward Samaria to attack Judas's troops.  He intends to attack on the Sabbath, knowing that the Jews will be unprepared to fight then.  Conscripted Jews in his army complain about the plan.  Preparing for battle, Judas relates to his troops a dream vision he says he had.  While asleep, he saw the deceased High Priest Onias III and the prophet Jeremiah.  Onias III says that Jeremiah is praying for all the people of Israel and Jeremiah gives Judas a golden sword.  The Maccabee army resolves to attack first, seeing the enemy prepared with war elephants and cavalry on their flanks.  Judas prays to God and invokes the dramatic past defeat of Sennacherib again.  The Jews win the battle and slay 35,000 soldiers, including Nicanor himself.  Nicanor's body is desecrated and his head is hung from the citadel in Jerusalem.  The Jews resolve to celebrate 13 Adar as Nicanor's Day.\n\nThe chapter is something of an echo of Chapter 8, which too featured Judas fighting Nicanor immediately after an account of martyrdom; the lead-up to the battle and the battle itself are described similarly in both chapters, and Nicanor is once again called \"thrice-accursed\".\n\nIt is not entirely clear whether Nicanor is successfully able to time the encounter to the Sabbath; it is immediately followed by a statement that \"he did not succeed in carrying out his abominable design,\" but it is unclear whether this statement foretells the coming ultimate defeat of Nicanor or merely means that he failed to time the attack on Judas's forces to the Sabbath day.  Some interpreters of 2 Maccabees believe that the author holds that even defensive warfare on the Sabbath is forbidden; others believe that the references to enemies attempting to attack on the Sabbath (including Nicanor here and Apollonius in 5:25-27) were merely showing how villainous they were in violating a holy day in an attempt to gain an advantage.  The later Hasmoneans certainly considered defensive warfare on the Sabbath permissible, as seen in 1 Maccabees.\n\nIn Judas's dream he relates to his troops, Jeremiah is said to pray for all the people.  This may simply be a reference to Jeremiah's popularity in the era, but also is a literary echo to the Book of Jeremiah.  In that work, Jeremiah is specifically urged by God not to pray for the people in the first half so that the prophesied destruction can take place.  It is only much later in Jeremiah 42 that he is allowed to pray for the people; a reference to Jeremiah himself praying for Judea suggests a powerful support and a turning point for those familiar with the work.  These verses were also used later in Catholic theology to support the doctrine of the intercession of saints who pray for the welfare of Christians on Earth.\n\nThe author is not particularly interested in the details of battle strategy and tactics, and instead emphasizes that it is a battle between the pious who trust in God and the impious.  As with similar figures in the book, the recorded casualty count of 35,000 is greatly inflated and considered entirely implausible.  Demetrius would presumably have concentrated most of his forces to oppose Timarchus during this time period, and the narrative itself already recounts that Nicanor was reduced to conscripting local Jews, suggesting that there were not even close to 35,000 Seleucid soldiers at the battle, let alone casualties.  The mention of war elephants is also considered unlikely to be accurate, as Polybius records that the Romans hamstrung all of the Seleucid's remaining elephants in 162 BCE.  While it is possible the Romans might have missed a few elephants, 1 Maccabees makes no reference to elephants appearing at this battle.\n\nThe new holiday of Nicanor's Day on 13 Adar is described as being \"the day before Mordecai's day\".  14 Adar is Purim; this account is one of the oldest pieces of surviving literature to refer to its commemoration.  It is unique in suggesting the holiday may have been called Mordecai's Day in the Hasmonean period; this appellation is not found in other surviving literature.  The writer is also aware that \"Adar\" is not a term originally from Hebrew, referring to it as a loanword.\n\nEpilogue\n\nVerses 37-39 are a brief epilogue from the epitomist concluding the history, expressing his hope that the reader enjoyed the work, and apologizing if the reader did not.\n\nVerse 37's confident declaration on the safety of Jerusalem suggests that the author apparently did not consider whatever happened in Jerusalem after Judas's defeat at Elasa as sufficiently bad to contradict this statement, was referring only to the Temple Sanctuary rather than the city as a whole, or else did not intend to extend the claim beyond Nicanor's defeat.  It could also be taken as a tacit admission that High Priest Alcimus, whose term would last until May 159 BCE, still qualified as a \"Hebrew\".  Verse 37 has also been used to argue for a later bound on the date of authorship. It suggests that 2 Maccabees was unlikely to have been written after 63 BCE, when the Hasmonean kingdom was reduced to client state status to the Roman Republic.  That said, there are different ways to interpret the tense of the statement in Greek, leaving some ambiguity.\n\nOne of the unknowns of the study of 2 Maccabees is if Jason of Cyrene's history also ended with Nicanor's defeat, or if it continued further and the later parts were omitted in the abridgment.  Jonathan A. Goldstein makes an argument that the epilogue suggests that Jason's history indeed went further, as the epitomist declines to say that Jason's history stopped hence his abridgment stopping as well.  To the extent that 2 Maccabees was intended as a \"festal book\" to be used as reading material during Nicanor's Day or Hanukkah, the establishment of the festival itself may have been a logical stopping point.\n\nJean Calvin was unimpressed with the epilogue's casual tone in apologizing if the reader disliked the work, and used it to argue in favor of the de-canonicalization of the book during the Protestant Reformation.  Calvin wrote \"He who confesses that his writings stand in need of pardon, certainly proclaims that they are not oracles of the Holy Spirit.\"\n\nThe epilogue makes an analogy to how water alone and wine alone are worse than drinking water mixed with wine, the common practice in the era when wine was stored in a very potent form for more efficient transit.  There was a Greek cultural belief that only Dionysus himself could drink unmixed wine without going crazy.  What exactly the water and wine correspond to is less clear; the original history of Jason of Cyrene being the wine and the epitomist's editing being the water to make it more palatable, perhaps?\n\nOne passage's phrasing can also be surprising to modern readers: the hope that the \"story delights the ears of those who read the work\".  In antiquity, \"silent reading\" was not common, and readers spoke aloud as they read, even if reading alone.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n NRSV text of 2 Maccabees: , , \n \n\nBooks of the Maccabees\nChapters of deuterocanonical books",

        "Jerry Francis Costello (born September 25, 1949) is an American politician and former U.S. Representative for . He previously represented  and served in the US House from 1988 to 2013. He is a member of the Democratic Party and was the dean of Illinois's 21-member congressional delegation. In October 2011, Costello announced that he would not seek another term in Congress in 2012.

He was later educated at Maryville College of the Sacred Heart in St. Louis, from which he earned a bachelor's degree.\n\nCostello worked in the law enforcement field. He served St. Clair County, Illinois as a court bailiff, deputy sheriff, and director of court services and probation. Costello later was chief investigator for the Illinois State Attorney’s office. In 1980, he was elected as chair of the St. Clair County Board. Costello served in this capacity as county executive until his election to the House.\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\n\nElections\nCostello took office on in August 1988, after winning a special election with 51% of the vote, to fill the seat of the deceased Melvin Price. He was elected to a full term that November with 53% of the vote. After that, he received at least 60% of the vote in all of his re-election bids, until his retirement in 2012.\n\nCostello was the most senior member of Illinois' House delegation during his final term in office.

At the end of an investigation and trial, a longtime friend of Costello's was sentenced to six years in prison for obstruction of justice. Costello testified before a grand jury in regard to the matter, but was not indicted or charged in the case. He denied any involvement. In 1997, the Congressional Accountability Project filed an ethics complaint requesting investigation of Costello which resulted in no action.\n\nCommittee assignments\nCommittee on Science, Space and Technology\nSubcommittee on Energy and Environment\nCommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure\nSubcommittee on Aviation (Ranking member)\nSubcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials\nSubcommittee on Water Resources and Environment\n\nPost-House\nIn 2016, Costello was a presidential elector from Illinois.

        "Theophilus Weeks (1708 – January 1772) was an early settler in the British colony of Province of North Carolina. He served as a soldier in the French and Indian War, and he was the founder of the town of Swansboro, North Carolina.\n\nEarly life \nTheophilus Weeks was born 1708 in Falmouth, Massachusetts. His parents were Benjamin and Mary Chase Weeks. In 1730, Benjamin Weeks moved the family to North Carolina, settling on Hadnots Creek.\n\nAt about the same time, another group from Falmouth, Jonathan Green, Sr., his brother Isaac Green, and their families, settled on the other side of the White Oak River, in what is now Onslow County (Onslow was formed from New Hanover and Carteret counties in 1734). The White Oak River forms the boundary between Onslow and Carteret counties.\n\nJonathan Green, Sr., died about 1735, at the age of about 35 years. On 7 October 1735, Theophilus Weeks married his widow, Grace, and moved into the Green plantation. In time, he bought out Isaac Green’s half interest in the property and the latter returned to Massachusetts. The plantation was located on the Onslow (west) side of the mouth of the White Oak River, and was named “The Wharf.”  Theophilus and Grace had at least four children. It is likely that he must have had a daughter or two, although their names are not known. At a court held 5 April 1743, Theophilus proved rights for eight white persons belonging to his family.\n\nThe religious affiliation of Theophilus Weeks is not known, however, he is descended from the Reverend John Robinson, pastor of the Pilgrims in Holland. Considering that many other members of the Weeks family in the Hadnots Creek area were deeply involved in the early Baptist movement, it is probable that Theophilus Weeks and his family were among them.\n\nIn January 1741 (New Style), he recorded his livestock branding, which indicated agricultural interests. In 1747 he borrowed some £200 from Colonel John Starkey, and used the land he had purchased from Isaac Green as security. Weeks repaid this loan repaid by the end of the next year. Weeks received two land grants in Onslow County on 6 April 1745, for  each. On 10 April 1761, four additional grants totaling , and on 4 May 1769, an additional  were received.\n\nIn 1754 the Onslow Regiment of Militia was organized in response to the French and Indian Wars. The regiment was divided into four companies, and Theophilus Weeks became a sergeant in Captain Stephen Lee’s company of Colonel John Starkey’s Onslow Regiment of Militia. He is listed on a unit roster dated 12 March 1754. It was to meet at Jonathan Milton’s residence on New River for a general muster.\n\nIn 1751 Weeks petitioned the Onslow Court for permission to operate an ordinary, and he did receive a license to “keep an ordinary at his now dwelling place.”  The White Oak River flows into Bogue Inlet, and this suggests that port activity was thriving at the mouth of the river, and that the Weeks’ plantation was a favorite place for seafarers to visit. He was appointed inspector of exports for Bogue Inlet in 1757, and he held that position for the rest of his life.\n\nOrigins of Swansboro \nProbably the greatest accomplishment of his life came with the founding of the town of Swansboro. His plantation, The Wharf, was an ideal location for trade and navigation, and as commerce increased, he saw the advantage it offered as a seaport.\n\nIt is not known exactly when he decided to establish a town on his property. It is possible that he considered the idea for years. His plans were finalized early in 1771, or possibly the year before.\n\nThe settlement was laid out with six streets, and contained forty-eight lots. The lots were arranged in three tiers, with sixteen lots each. Three of the streets ran basically north and south, and the other three east and west. They are known today as Front, Water, Elm, Moore, Main (originally Broad), and Church Streets. A county road extended northeastward from Broad Street to the Onslow Courthouse (which no longer exists, as the Onslow county seat is now at Jacksonville). All the streets were  wide, except Front and Broad Streets, which were . All the original lots were 60 x , except on the north side of Front Street. These seven water lots (numbers 10-16) extended across it to the river.\n\nSale of the lots went slowly, and only five of the forty-eight had been sold when Theophilus died. The Weeks home was on the west side of Broad Street (now Main), lot #7, somewhere between Front and Water Streets, just up from the wharf so he could see the ships as they came in. A dock was located nearby where ships tied up for him to inspect their cargo. Lot #6 was sold to Edward Starkey on 11 May 1771, and Lots #2 and #5 were sold to Ezekiel Hunter. Lot #11 was sold to Mrs. Mary Pitts, who received the deed for what was called \"lot number 11 in the plan of a town laid out by Theophilus Weeks.\" One of the town’s original houses, that of Jonathan Green, Jr.’s son, Samuel, is still standing.\n\nThe town was known by several names during its early years. Some people referred to it as Weeks Point, Weeks Landing, Weeks Wharf, The Wharf, and others as New Town. In one petition, it is called \"New Town upon Bogue.\" It was generally called Bogue during the Revolutionary War era. The confusion was finally settled in 1783, when it was incorporated and an act of the General Assembly officially named it Swansborough, in honor of Samuel Swann, Speaker of the colonial assembly and official representative of Onslow in the Assembly. The name was later shortened to Swansboro.\n\nLater life \nThe exact date and cause of Theophilus Weeks’ death are unknown. It was probably in early January, 1772. He last appears in the public records on 1 January 1772, when he and his wife sold  to Archibald Gillespie. When the Onslow Court met a few days later, Gillespie was appointed inspector for Bogue Inlet, “in the room of Theophilus Weeks, deceased.”  His wife, Grace, died in August 1792.\n\nSwansboro celebrated its bicentennial in 1983. About 150 people were on hand, of whom 85 were descendants of him or his brother, Jabez. As part of the Fourth of July celebration, a memorial marker was dedicated to Theophilus Weeks as founder of Swansboro.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nExcerpts from Claiborne S.

These violations may manifest through aberrant sex, mutations, mutilation, zombification, gratuitous violence, disease, or unnatural movements of the body. Body horror was a description originally applied to an emerging subgenre of North American horror films, but has roots in early Gothic literature and has expanded to include other media.\n\nCharacteristics \nAccording to the film scholar Linda Williams, body horror falls into one of three \"gross\" genres or \"genres of excess\" which also includes pornography and melodrama. Williams writes that the success of these body genres \"is often measured by the degree to which the audience sensation mimics what is seen on the screen\". For example, an audience may experience feelings of terror through horror, sympathy through melodrama, or sexual arousal through pornography. Body horror specifically focuses on the limits and transformative capabilities of the human body.\n\nBody horror often overlaps with, but is distinct from, other horror subgenres. For example, while elements of mutilation may be present in body horror, other similar subgenres such as slasher, splatter, or monster horror may also share this trope, but differ in message and intent. A common difference in the body horror genre is that violations or distortions of the body are rarely the result of immediate or initial violence. Instead, they are generally marked by a loss of conscious control over the body through mutation, disease, or other tropes involving uncontrolled transformation. The genre can invoke intense feelings of physical and psychological disgust, or squick, and play upon anxieties of physical vulnerability. In addition to common tropes used within the broader horror genre, some tropes specific to the body horror subgenre may include invasion, contagion, mutation, transformation, disease, mutilation, or other unnatural or violent distortions of the human body.\n\nBody horror films, such as Crimes of the Future and Titane, have been likened to erotic horror.\n\nHistory \nThe term \"body horror\" was first used by Phillip Brophy in his 1983 article \"Horrality: The Textuality of the Contemporary Horror Film\". He coined this term to describe an emerging subgenre which occurred during a short golden period for contemporary horror film. Although Brophy coined the term to specifically describe a trend within cinema, film director Stuart Gordon notes that the body horror trope had existed before its adaptation to the screen, most notably within fictional writing.\n\nLiterature \nMary Shelley's Frankenstein (1818) is an early example of the body horror subgenre within fictional writing. The success of gothic horror in the 19th century, in combination with the birth of science fiction as a literary form, is thought to be the origin of body horror as a literary genre. According to Halberstam, \"By focusing on the body as a locus of fear, Shelley's novel suggests that it is people (or at least bodies) who terrify people... the landscape of fear is replaced by sutured skin.\"\n\nFranz Kafka's The Metamorphosis is another early example of body horror literature. It shows Gregor Samsa transform into a large bug for unknown reasons. The work has influenced other body horrors like The Fly.\n\nFilm \nCanadian filmmaker David Cronenberg is considered a principal originator of body horror through early films such as Shivers and Rabid, and his remake of The Fly. However, body horror tropes existed within film prior to official recognition of the genre. Early examples of the body horror genre arose out of 1950s American horror cinema including The Blob and The Fly, both of which set the standard for the genre due to the films' primary focus on mutation and visceral special effects. Many contemporary films of the horror genre (those produced after 1968), including body horror, are considered to be postmodern in contrast to classical horror. Because of this, delineations between the genres are difficult to define, since postmodernism is concerned with blurring boundaries between categories.\n\nThe body horror genre is widely represented throughout Japanese horror and within contemporary media, such as anime. Katsuhiro Otomo's 1988 film Akira is an early example of body horror within anime. The film uses the genre to explore the \"notion of the adolescent body as a site of metamorphosis, a metamorphosis that can appear monstrous both to the figure undergoing it and to the outside world.\"\n\nComics and graphic novels \nMany manga authors, such as Junji Ito, specialize in writing within the horror genre and use body horror tropes in combination with narrative storytelling devices of Japanese horror. Highly influenced by the literary works of H. P. Lovecraft, Ito's manga depict obscene body horror through both aesthetic and narrative in order to invoke feelings of abject terror. In contrast, Canadian cartoonist Michael DeForge incorporates recurring body horror aspects within his work through less graphic aesthetic and narrative styles.\n\nInfluences \nFilms and media that fall under the body horror subgenre reflect a specific corporeal societal anxiety and may provide social commentary about history and influence contemporary culture.\n\nControversy and censorship \nSince the 18th century, the horror genre has been popular among readers but dismissed as controversial by some critics who saw the genre and its thematic elements threatening or dangerous to society.\n\nBecause of the use of graphic and gratuitous violence or themes that may be considered taboo, horror media that fall within the body horror genre are often censored or banned across a variety of countries. For example, the Saw and Human Centipede franchises have been referred to as \"torture porn\" and widely criticized to include overly \"exploitative, gratuitous portrayals of destructive sexual perversion.\"\n\nSee also \nAbjection\nErotic horror\n\nBarbara Creed\nGrotesque body\nList of body horror media\nPsychological horror\nSplatterpunk\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \nFilm genres\nHorror genres\nHorror\nHuman appearance",

        "Compsopogon caeruleus is a species of red algae that lives in fresh water. It is the only species in the genus Compsopogon and the only representative of the family Compsopogonaceae. It is found in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, Australasia and Oceania. Compsopogon can  tolerate a wide range of conditions in freshwater streams and occasionally in brackish lagoons and estuaries. It propagates by asexual spores.\n\nCompsopogon presents a thallus of simple cylindrical cells inside large covered cortical cells. In more mature and large thallus interior cells can be disintegrated, leaving only the outer cortex.\n\nThe species exhibits a wide phenotypic plasticity in studies such as field observations, with the result that historically many species have been described, when current thought treats it as a single species. There are two main morphologies in Compsopogon, one displaying regular cortical cells (morphology caeruleus), the other having cells with extra rhizoidals (morphology leptoclados).\n\nReferences\n\nRed algae genera\nCompsopogonophyceae",

The school was established on April 6, 1925, with an emphasis on fostering science education and modern languages studies.\n\nSchool history\nPrince of Wales School was inaugurated by His Royal Highness, the Prince of Wales, on April 6, 1925. It is one of Sierra Leone's top schools.\n\nThe Prince of Wales School was formally established in Freetown, Sierra Leone on April 6, 1925, with a purposeful insistence on fostering science education, and studies in modern languages. The school marked a turning point in secondary education in Sierra Leone, as its inception ushered the period in which the Sierra Leone government actively sought to control wasteful multiplication, religious bigotry, and denominational rivalry in secondary school.\n\nSince its inauguration, the Prince of Wales School has demonstrated, with consistency, an affinity for Excellence in Education by relentlessly providing a model for a Balanced and High Quality Education at the secondary level in Sierra Leone. Its graduates have also occupied prominent positions of trust, altruism, and responsibility in Sierra Leone as well as in the international community.\n\nThe Prince of Wales Alumni Association-Georgia Branch was founded in 2002 by a cohort of former Students of the Prince of Wales Secondary School residing in the United States who not only saw the need for substantial financial, material and infra-structural support to their alma mater but also were prepared to make the necessary sacrifices destined to improve the quality of teaching and learning at the Prince of Wales School in Sierra Leone. Their patriotic zeal coupled with their conviction that they could make a difference in improving the human condition as well as positively influence posterity gave birth to the Prince Of Wales Alumni Association - Georgia Branch, U.S.A.\n\nFrancis Nicol, Ph.

Though scattered far we seldom meet the friends our boyhood knew,\nOld joys and griefs in memory dwell, toned down to sober hue,\nAnd as some well remembered name grows great, we glow with pride,\nTo think that in our youthful days, we struggled at his side.\n\n5. And when at last old age is ours and manhood's strength has fled,\nAnd young ambition's fire is cold and earthly hopes lie dead;\nWe feel our boyhood's thrill once more and think its just life's morn,\nAnd keep a niche within our hearts for Prince of Wales, Kingtom.\n\nExternal links\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20031214053728/http://www.oldprincewaleans.com/\nhttp://www.powaa.org/index.asp?action=page&name=1\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20070930045600/http://www.opwa-usa.org/home.htm\n http://www.globalprincewalean.org\n\nSecondary schools in Sierra Leone\nEducational institutions established in 1925\nSchools in Freetown\n1925 establishments in Sierra Leone",

        "A Line Made by Walking is a 1967 sculpture by British artist Richard Long. The piece was made when Long walked a continuous line into a field of grass in Wiltshire, England, and then photographed the result. The work is considered to be an important early work in the history of both land art and conceptual art. It has been described as among Long's signature works, and as his \"best-known early piece\".\n\nHistory\nA Line Made by Walking was made in 1967 when Long was a 22-year-old art student at Saint Martin's School of Art, London. At the time, Long commuted regularly between his home in Bristol and the school, a journey of around 120 miles. Stopping in Wiltshire, he found a grassy area and  walked a straight path in it repeatedly until a line was visible. He then took a black and white photograph of the result.\n\nThe work was considered innovative at the time as it proposed that the simple act of walking could be an art form, and that art could be produced by the foot as well as the hand. The piece also questioned whether the performance – or the document of the performance – was the actual artwork. As such it presented a challenge to what was traditionally understood to be as sculpture. The work, which set the tone for Long's career as an artist, was one of his earliest pieces and his first walking-based piece. In the context of Long's career, A Line Made by Walking manifested the artist's fascination with trails and traces as mapped histories, a very prevalent theme in his work.\n\nA Line Made by Walking established Long as a minimalist and conceptual sculptor; it was also an early example of land art. Long created several pieces which hark back to the 1967 original including circles or organic paths, some in snow, dust, or even charred grass. These include Walking a Line in Peru (1972), a narrow path walked across a wide plain, leading to the foothills of distant mountains; A Line and Tracks in Bolivia (1981), approximately 150 feet long with accompanying tracks intersecting; Sea Level Waterline in Death Valley, California (1982), a path walked at the zero foot contour, representing sea level in low-lying Death Valley; and A Line in Nepal (1983), a forest path approximately 50 feet long.\n\nCollections\nThe work is held in the collections of the Tate Museum, London, the Courtald Gallery,  the Getty Museum and the National Galleries of Scotland. It has also been on display in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York, as part of a major exhibition of Long's work held by that museum in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe 2017 novel, A Line Made by Walking, by Sara Baume, is named for the artwork.\n\nReferences\n\n1967 sculptures\nLand art\nWalking art",

        "Lysmata wurdemanni, commonly known as the peppermint shrimp, is a species of shrimp.\n\nDescription\nIt reaches  in length, and is named for the bright red stripes on its otherwise translucent body, which are reminiscent of peppermint candies such as a candy cane. Its eggs, by contrast, are bright green.\n\nDistribution\nLysmata wurdemanni was originally described from specimens collected at Key West, Florida and Charleston, South Carolina. Its range extends along the Atlantic seaboard of the United States from Long Island to Florida, and along the Gulf of Mexico from Florida to Port Aransas, Texas. It may also occur in the northern Caribbean Sea, but this has not been confirmed.\n\nReproduction\n\nLysmata wurdemanni is a protandric simultaneous hermaphrodite. This means that it begins as a male but may later become a hermaphrodite. It has four moults as a male before changing sexes to become a euhermaphrodite. However, under certain conditions some males never change to hermaphrodites. In the euhermaphrodite stage the shrimp act as a male between moults and as a female immediately following a moult. During this hermaphroditic stage the shrimp gradually lose their male organs, likely because more energy is being allocated to the development of female reproductive organs.\n\nLysmata wurdemanni employs a 'pure searching' tactic for mate-finding in which the males are constantly searching for receptive females. Males use olfactory organs (aesthetascs) on their antennules to detect soluble female sex pheromones (distance pheromones). These pheromones are released 2–8 hours prior to female moulting. Guided by these chemical signals, males make their way to the female and will approach her. The male will then 'taste' the female's contact pheromones with his aesthetascs to make sure she is a suitable mate. If the chemicals are right, courtship may commence and, if courtship goes well, copulation will ensue. This process is very brief and occurs immediately post-moult, while the female's cuticle is new and soft.\n\nAquaria\nLysmata wurdemanni is a reef safe cleaning animal which consumes parasites and dead or diseased tissue from other animals, and is therefore used in marine aquariums. Additionally, these shrimp are known to consume the Aiptasia or \"glass\" anemone which is regarded as a pest and is difficult to eradicate from home salt-water aquariums. The hatching of eggs, moulting, and copulation cycle is identical to that of L. debelius, yielding weekly batches of zoeae from each pair.\n\nTaxonomy\nThe species L. wurdemanni has undergone reclassification and has been divided into four distinct species – L. wurdemanni, L. ankeri, L. bahia and L. boggessii. More recent molecular phylogenetic work found that L. wurdemanni is a cryptic species with at least 5 (and potentially 9) morphologically identical species being present across its range.\n\nReferences\n\nAlpheoidea\nCrustaceans of the Atlantic Ocean\nCrustaceans described in 1850",

        "Rany Jazayerli (born June 14, 1975), a Chicago-area dermatologist, is a co-founder of and writer for Baseball Prospectus. He developed the statistical concept of Pitcher Abuse Points (PAP), which relates to high pitch counts in baseball.\n\nJazayerli is a graduate of Johns Hopkins University and the University of Michigan School of Medicine. He is a board-certified dermatologist and a Fellow of the American Academy of Dermatology.\n\nWorks\nSince 1996 Jazayerli has co-authored many of the annual Baseball Prospectus volumes.  He also writes occasional “Doctoring the Numbers” columns for BaseballProspectus.com in which he investigates topics from a sabermetric perspective. He is the creator of the sabermetric measure of \"Pitcher Abuse Points.\"  Jazayerli has published seminal research on the relative merits of the 4-man and 5-man pitching rotation.  His most important recent major research contribution is a series of twelve articles published on BaseballProspectus.com in 2005-2006 reporting a massive study of the changing patterns of the Major League Baseball player draft.\n\nHe and Rob Neyer of ESPN co-authored a blog called “Rob & Rany on the Royals,” in which they both would lament the performance of the Kansas City Royals major league franchise. He now writes his own blog, \"Rany on the Royals,\". Since 2011 he has been a contributing writer to Grantland.\n\nHe has also contributed essays on politics to FiveThirtyEight.com.\n\nPlea for tolerance\nShortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, Jazayerli wrote a “Plea for Tolerance” on ESPN.com’s “Page 2”.  In his plea, Jazayerli observed:  “I have been a baseball writer for over six years, and hardly a day goes by that I don't count my blessings for the opportunity to write about the most uniquely American pastime. But today I can't afford to think about our Great American Game, because I'm too busy thinking about what it means to be an American.  You see, I am a Muslim. I am an Arab-American. And right now I am scared to death that in a country I have loved all my life — in the only country I have ever called my own — I am no longer truly free. I feel imprisoned by the hatred of others, those blind to the difference between a sick, demented terrorist and a peace-loving American . . . . Today, I hope that the accomplishments of Muslim and Arab athletes in this country, both on and off the field, will help remind us of the basic humanity in people of all backgrounds. I hope that people might reflect on the charisma and genius of a Muhammad Ali, or the grace of a Hakeem Olajuwon, and understand that just as Muslim athletes are committed to the same goals, on and off the field, as their fellow athletes, so too are Muslims in this country as innately American as anyone else.”\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links\nRany on the Royals\n\nBaseball statisticians\nJazayerli, Rany\nJazayerli, Rany\nJazayerli, Rany\n1975 births\nAmerican people of Syrian descent\nAmerican Muslims\nLiving people\nAmerican dermatologists",

        "The COPINE scale is a rating system created in Ireland and used in the United Kingdom to categorise the severity of images of child sex abuse. The scale was developed by staff at the COPINE (\"Combating Paedophile Information Networks in Europe\") project. The COPINE Project was founded in 1997, and is based in the Department of Applied Psychology, University College Cork, Ireland.\n\nUse\n\nTherapeutic\nThe COPINE scale was originally developed for therapeutic psychological purposes.\n\nMore specifically, it is used to distinguish between child erotica and child pornography.\n\nProfessor Max Taylor, one of the academics working for the COPINE project, stated: \"The significance of this distinction is to emphasise the potential sexual qualities of a whole range of kinds of photographs (and other material as well) not all of which may meet obscenity criteria.\"\n\nJudicial\nIn the late 1990s, the COPINE project at the University College Cork, in cooperation with the Paedophile Unit of the London Metropolitan Police, developed a typology to categorize child abuse images for use in both research and law enforcement. The ten-level typology was based on analysis of images available on websites and internet newsgroups. Other researchers have adopted similar ten-level scales.\n\nThe SAP scale\nThe 2002 case of Regina v. Oliver in the Court of Appeal of England and Wales established a scale by which indecent images of children could be \"graded\". The five point scale, established by the Sentencing Advisory Panel for England and Wales and adopted in 2002, is known as the SAP scale. It is based on COPINE terminology and is often mistakenly referred to as such.\n\nThe SAP document gives a detailed explanation of how the COPINE scale was adapted. It also states that the COPINE scale was intended for therapeutic use and not designed for use in court. Examination of the categories will show that categories 2–5 of the SAP scale obviously correspond to categories 7–10 of the COPINE scale. Category 1 of the SAP scale seems to correspond vaguely to categories 4–6 of the COPINE scale. COPINE category 1 (indicative) was left off the SAP scale because \"images of this nature would not be classed as indecent.\" The board found COPINE categories 2 & 3 to be disputable as to whether or not they can be classified as indecent.\n\nSexual Offences Definitive Guideline \nOn 1 April 2014, a new scale, replacing the SAP scale, was adopted for sentencing in England and Wales for crimes relating to indecent images of children, put into place by page 75 of the Sentencing Council's Sexual Offences Definitive Guideline.\n\nSee also\nInternet pornography\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n COPINE Project\n old link COPINE project (archived)\n Sentencing Guidelines (England and Wales) (This sentencing advice is from 2002 and has been superseded by Sexual Offenses Sentencing Guidelines)\n\nPornography law\nRating systems\nChild pornography",

        "Paraphasia is a type of language output error commonly associated with aphasia, and characterized by the production of unintended syllables, words, or phrases during the effort to speak. Paraphasic errors are most common in patients with fluent forms of aphasia, and come in three forms: phonemic or literal, neologistic, and verbal. Paraphasias can affect metrical information, segmental information, number of syllables, or both. Some paraphasias preserve the meter without segmentation, and some do the opposite. However, most paraphasias affect both partially.\n\nThe term was apparently introduced in 1877 by the German-English physician Julius Althaus in his book on Diseases of the Nervous System, in a sentence reading, \"In some cases there is a perfect chorea or delirium of words, which may be called paraphasia\".\n\nCauses\nParaphasia is associated with fluent aphasias, characterized by “fluent spontaneous speech, long grammatically shaped sentences and preserved prosody abilities.” Examples of these fluent aphasias include receptive or Wernicke’s aphasia, anomic aphasia, conduction aphasia, and transcortical sensory aphasia, among others. All of these lead to a difference in processing efficiency, which is often caused by damage to a cortical region in the brain (in receptive aphasia, for example, the lesion is in or near Wernicke’s area); lesion location is the most important determining factor for all aphasic disorders, including paraphasia - the location of the lesion can be used to hypothesize the type of aphasic symptoms the patient will display. This lesion can be caused by a variety of different methods: malfunctioning blood vessels (caused, for example, by a stroke) in the brain are the cause of 80% of aphasias in adults, as compared to head injuries, dementia and degenerative diseases, poisoning, metabolic disorders, infectious diseases, and demyelinating diseases. Lesions involving the posterior superior temporal lobe are often associated with fluent aphasias.\n\nDamage to the brain's language centers\n\nTwo areas of the brain, Broca’s area and Wernicke’s area, are responsible for various disruptions in speech when damaged. Each is defined by their distinct characteristics. Broca’s aphasia is characterized by non-fluent or telegraphic-type speech - where articles, conjunctions, prepositions, auxiliary verbs, pronouns and morphological inflections (plurals, past tense) are omitted.  The word substitutions are infrequent and distortion of consonants and simplification of consonant clusters is frequent. Content words such as nouns, verbs and adjectives may be preserved. Subjects of this aphasia are aware of their errors in speech. Damage to the Broca’s area does not affect comprehension of speech.\n\nWernicke’s aphasia is characterized by fluent language with made up or unnecessary words with little or no meaning to speech. Those who suffer from this type of aphasia have difficulty understanding others speech and are unaware of their own mistakes. When corrected they will repeat their verbal paraphasias and have trouble finding the correct word. Wernicke’s area is found in the dominant hemisphere of the posterior gyrus of the first temporal convolution of the brain, whereas Broca’s area is found anterior to the Wernicke’s area.\n\nSymptoms\n\nPhonemic paraphasia\nPhonemic paraphasia, also referred to as phonological paraphasia or literal paraphasia, refers to the substitution of a word with a nonword that preserves at least half of the segments and/or number of syllables of the intended word. This can lead to a variety of errors, including formal ones, in which one word is replaced with another phonologically related to the intended word; phonemic ones, in which one word is replaced with a nonword phonologically related to the intended word; and approximations, an attempt to find the word without producing either a word or nonword. These types of errors are associated with Wernicke's aphasia, among others. Phonemic paraphasias are often caused by lesions to the external capsule, extending to the posterior part of the temporal lobe or internal capsule. This type of paraphasia also occurs in other languages as well. For example, case studies have been performed with German speakers, which demonstrated that 30.8% of paraphasias occurred at the beginning of the word in patients with Wernicke's aphasia and 22.6% for patients with Broca's aphasia. In English speakers this tendency to create errors at the beginning of the word remained.\n Types of phonemic paraphasias\n Anticipatory errors occur when a syllable from later in the word replaces a syllable from earlier in the word - \"papple\" for apple or \"lelephone\" for telephone.\n Perseverative errors occur when a syllable from earlier in the word replaces a syllable from later in the word - for example, \"gingerjed\" for gingerbread.\n Paradigmatic errors based on similarity in how the sounds are formed can also occur - \"marmer\" for barber, i.e.\n Addition errors, in which a segment is added that bears no relation to the intended word, are much rarer than anticipatory, perseverative, or paradigmatic errors, though they do occur. Most often what can be mistaken for an addition error is an anticipatory error from the words surrounding the intended one. However, an example of a possible addition error could be \"selezant\" for elephant.\n Substitution errors involve a clear phonological substitution, such as \"ragon\" for wagon.\n Epenthetic errors are the insertion of a segment into the target, as in the case of \"plants\" for pants.\n Finally, metathetical errors are the full exchange of segments like \"deks\" for desk.\n\nNeologistic paraphasia\nNeologistic paraphasias, a substitution with a non-English or gibberish word, follow pauses indicating word-finding difficulty. They can affect any part of speech, and the previously mentioned pause can be used to indicate the relative severity of the neologism; less severe neologistic paraphasias can be recognized as a distortion of a real word, and more severe ones cannot. The hypothesized source for these neologisms is “a device which quasirandomly combines English phonemes in a phonotactically regular way.” A neologistic paraphasia can be thought of as a neologism resulting from aphasia, rather than any other of the sources with which they are associated. Neologistic paraphasia is often associated with receptive aphasia and jargon aphasia.\n Types of Neologistic paraphasias\n There are also various types of neologistic paraphasias. They can be phonologically related to a prior word, a following word, the intended word, or another neologism. The neologistic paraphasia shares phonemes or the position of phonemes with the related word. This most often occurs when the word and neologistic paraphasia are in the same clause. Neologistic paraphasias have a less stringent relationship with the target word than phonological paraphasias - where a phonological paraphasia has more than half of the target word’s phonemes, a neologistic paraphasia has less than half.\n\nVerbal paraphasia\nVerbal paraphasias are confusions of words or the replacement of one word by another real word; another definition is that of a contextually inappropriate English word or an English word of a syntactically incorrect class -  the wrong part of speech, for example. Verbal paraphasias do not often preserve length, although the gender of the target word was preserved in more than half of the errors in one case study. It is hypothesized that verbal paraphasias are not the result of a random process but from a precise deficit in a single area. Verbal paraphasias are the only type of paraphasias that can also be linked to nonfluent aphasias, and they are mainly caused by lesions to the posterior temporal region of the brain, the head of the caudate nucleus, or both.\n Examples\n These errors can be semantic, in which the meaning of the word is related to that of the intended word (car for van, for example). Semantic paraphasias can be further subdivided into six different types.\n Coordinate semantic paraphasias replace the target word with one that is from the same category, such as tiger for lion.\n Associate semantic paraphasias replace the target word with one that is related to the target but is not of the same category, like replacing foot with shoe.\n Superordinate semantic paraphasias replace a specific target word with a more generalized group to which the target word involves, such as replacing pear with fruit.\n Subordinate semantic paraphasias are the opposite of superordinate semantic paraphasias and replace the target word with one that is more specific - rose, for flower, for example.\n Part-whole semantic paraphasias replace the \"whole\" with the \"part\" as in finger for hand; or, conversely, the part with the whole, in the case of leg for foot.\n Finally, a visual semantic paraphasia replaces the target word with a word that shares visual features with the target, such as knife for nail.\n Random errors, in which the word has no relation to the target, also occur.\n\nPerseverative paraphasia\nPerseverative paraphasia is a type of paraphasia in which the previous response persists and interferes with retrieval of new responses. (See the experimental case study D.L.A published by Dennis in 1976.) It is associated with lesions in the left caudate nucleus.\n\nTreatment\nMany language impairments, including paraphasic errors, are reduced in number through spontaneous recovery of neurological function; this occurs most often with stroke patients within the first three months of recovery. Lesions associated with ischemic strokes have a shorter spontaneous recovery time, within the first two weeks; on the other hand, lesions associated with hemorrhagic strokes have a longer period for spontaneous recovery, from four to eight weeks. Whether spontaneous recovery occurs or not, treatment must begin immediately after the stroke, with support from a speech therapist or speech pathologist. A traditional approach requires treatment beginning at the level of breakdown—in the case of paraphasia, at the level of the phoneme. There are commercially available workbooks that provide various activities such as letter, word-picture, or word-word matching, and sentence completion, among other things. The difficulty of these activities varies with the level of treatment. However, these treatments have not been proven to be clinically productive.\n\nA 1988 study by Mary Boyle proposed a method focused on oral reading to treat phonemic paraphasias, which was partially successful, resulting in fewer phonemic paraphasias but a slower rate of speech. Treatments lasted for 50 minutes and occurred once a week. During these treatment sessions, the patient was instructed to look at twenty different phrases, each consisting of one to three syllables, then read the phrase. If the patient failed to read the phrase, the process was repeated. If the patient failed to read the phrase again, the process was abandoned. To progress from a set of one syllable phrases to two syllable phrases and two syllable phrases to three syllable phrases, an 80% success rate was necessary. This treatment was partially successful. Although fewer phonemic paraphasias were produced due to this treatment, speaking efficiency was not improved by this study. This is partially because the focus of the treatment was on sound production rather than semantic content. Improvements lasted for six weeks before the patient regressed.\n\nExperimental (magnetic-stimulation-induced) paraphasias\nTransient paraphasias (as well as other language defects such as speech arrest) can be generated by artificially activating the brain's language network with Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). With navigated TMS (nTMS), nodes of the language network can be located presurgically so that critical areas can be saved when performing tumor or epilepsy surgery. Marketed by Nexstim, this method has received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance in the United States.\n\nSee also \n Ganser syndrome\n Language disorder\n Lists of language disorders\n Malapropism\n Speech disfluency\n Paragraphia - Similar to Paraphasia, but for written languages\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n \n \n \"I Can't Come Up with the Right Word...\" by William Barr, Ph.D., ABPP\n \n ScienceDaily - 'Weapons Of Mass Production', I Mean, 'Mass Destruction!'

        "Duiliu Marcu (25 March 1885 – 9 March 1966) was a Romanian architect, one of the most well known and prolific of the interwar period. With a career spanning from 1912 to 1966, he is said to have designed 150 public and private projects across Romania, his work reflecting the evolution of local architecture in the first half of the 20th century from French Renaissance, though Neo-Romanian to modernism. Though also designing private villas and apartments, he designed some of the major interwar public buildings in the country, including the Timișoara Theatre, the Elisabeth Palace in Bucharest for the royal family, and the Victory Palace, which now houses the office of the Prime Minister.\n\nBiography\nBorn in 1885 in Calafat, a small town on the Danube (now on the border with Serbia), Marcu came from a modest family. In 1900 he enrolled in the new Carol I High School in Craiova, where he was  awarded special prizes in drawing. In 1905, he decided to attend the School of Architecture in Bucharest, but after only a year he left for Paris, where he studied at the famous École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, graduating in 1912.\n\nAlmost immediately he gained prestigious commissions, and by the mid 1930s he  was practically the government’s preferred architect. \n\nIn his biography which he published in 1960, he divides his career into three phases, which overlap : \"works of classical conception\", that is academic and eclectic architecture, which stretches from 1912 to 1925; “traditional architectural works”, that is Neo-Romanian architecture between 1920 and 1930; and “works of modern Romanian architecture”, between 1925 and 1960, the year of publication of the work (though he ceased designing in 1945).  \n\nAfter World War II, he continued his teaching and pedagogical activities, having already been Professor of \"city aesthetics\" at the Higher School of State Sciences in Bucharest (1923-1927) and substitute teacher at the Higher School of Architecture in Bucharest (now the Ion Mincu Architecture University) from 1927, which in 1929 became a professorship, which he held until 1957. He also became president of the Romanian Architects’ Union (1953-1966), and from 1955 a member of the Romanian Academy. He died 9 March 1966 in Bucharest.\n\nArchitecture\n\nIn 1912-1913, his first job on returning from Paris was to work with architect Nicolae Ghica-Budești on the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics addition to the University of Bucharest, in the heart of the city; the design carried on the French Academic classicism of the existing University buildings, with flattened pilasters and prominent dormer windows. His next notable project was the grand Vasilescu Villa, also French Beaux-Arts style, typical for the period before World War I. \n\nBy the early 1920s he was practicing in the newly fashionable Neo-Romanian style, beginning with the large commission for the  at the Timișoara Polytechnic, and then applied to another large project, the Timișoara Opera, in 1923-27. Instead of only applying the details of other architects, he made his own study trips, his research focuses especially on the Brancoveanu style, peasant houses in his native region, Oltenia, as well as on the monasteries in Moldova, which explains the presence of Byzantine as well as regional influences in his Neo-Romanian works. \n\nBy the early 1930s, along with most Romanian architects, his work was heavily influenced by the modern movement, but often combined with traditional or classical influences. He produced a number of simple cubic villas with a single arched doorway or rustic details, but also some simple streamlined apartment houses. A well known commercial project from this time was the modernisation of the Athenee Palace Hotel in the mid 30s, taking it from pre-war eclectic to a more refined image. The Royal Railway Stations at both Sinaia and Băneasa are elegant, stylised classical pavilions, while the House of State Monopolies in Bucharest is his most daring modern design.\n\nHe is best known for designing some of the largest government building projects in Bucharest in the 1930s, employing stylised classical forms influenced by Italian rationalist architecture of the period. They include the CFR (State Railways) Palace, the Military Academy, and finally the huge Victory Palace.\n\nSelected Projects \nA full list of his projects can be found at the META page for Diuliu Marcu.\n Faculty of Mathematics, University of Bucharest, 14 Academy Street, 1912–1913. \n Villa CM Vasilescu, 54 Lascăr Catargiu Street, Bucharest, 1915–1916\n Polytechnic of Timișoara, first three buildings:  1920–1923; dormitory 1927; canteen 1930 \n Theater of Timișoara, 1923–1928 (façade 1934-36).\n Dr. Anton Dobrovici House, 40 Lascăr Catargiu Street, 1922–1925\n Union Square, Oradea, (layout, lamps, fences), 1926\n Romanian Pavilion, Barcelona Expo, 1929 (demolished)\n Elisabeta Palace, designed 1930, built 1936–1937\n Bușilă House, 1 Rabat Street, 1932-1933\n Nestor Block, Calei Victoriei, Bucharest, 1932–1934 and 1937–1939 (destroyed by the 1977 Vrancea earthquake)\n Villa Olga Ștefănescu, Sinaia, 1934\n Luca Bădescu House, 1 Muzeul Zambaccian Street, 1934\n Three Apartment buildings, 17, 18, 20, Știrbei Vodă Street, 1935-1937\n Royal Railway Stations, Băneasa, Bucharest, and Sinaia, 1938\n CFR Palace, Gara de Nord, Bucharest, 1934–1937\n , Calea Victoriei, Bucharest, 1934–1941\n Athenee Palace Hotel, Calea Victoriei Bucharest, 1935–1937 (renovation alteration of the facades)\n Military Academy, 68-72 Șoseaua Panduri, Bucharest, 1937–1939 (now the Carol I National Defence University)\n Victory Palace, Piața Victoriei Bucharest, 1937–1944–1952 (now housing the office of the Prime Minister.)\n\nGallery\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1885 births\n1966 deaths\nPeople from Calafat\nCarol I National College alumni\nRomanian architects\nTitular members of the Romanian Academy",

In Austin, Texas, and in Gainesville, Florida, students began by providing themselves with meal plans. These programs eventually led to early housing co-ops.\n\nThese co-ops continued, observing and participating in the rise of the Cooperative League of the USA (CLUSA), and weathering the First World War and the Red Scare of 1919. As the twenties came to an end and the Great Depression set in students, like most people in the US and Canada, were barely able to get by. However, the co-op activist and religious leader Toyohiko Kagawa provided the nation's students with a renewed vision of social and economic cooperation. With the spark of Kagawa's enthusiasm, the 1930s saw the establishment of such long-standing co-ops systems as those in Berkeley, California; Ann Arbor, Michigan; and Toronto, Ontario.\n\nThe Second World War slowed much of the momentum of this period; many co-op members were drafted for the war effort. However, the end of the war, with the introduction of the GI Bill, saw new demands for student housing and the establishment of co-op systems in Ithaca, New York; Oberlin, Ohio; and Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\nThe late forties also saw the first attempt at a national student co-op organization: the North American Student Cooperative League (NASCL). Although quite successful at first, NASCL lost its major funding source, CLUSA, who cut support in the mid-fifties.\n\nIn the sixties, the political fervor over the free speech movement and the antiwar movement brought new enthusiasm to student cooperatives, this time as a social and political alternative to the postindustrial capitalist system. Government support in the form of low-interest housing loans in the US and Canada also contributed to the new boom in student co-ops. In 1968, the new NASCL, the North American Students of Cooperation (NASCO), was formed. Since that time, NASCO has served as the main networking and support system for student co-ops.\n\nSee also\n\nNorth American Students of Cooperation\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \n\"A Chronological History of the MSU SHC Houses\", msu.coop.\n\nExternal links\nSHC Homepage\nNASCO Homepage\n\nMichigan State University\nStudent housing cooperatives in the United States\nResidential buildings in Michigan",

        "Mohamed Chalali (born 4 April 1989) is an Algerian footballer. He plays for FC Versailles 78 in the Championnat National 3.\n\nPersonal \nChalali was born in Montreuil-sous-Bois, Paris, to Algerian parents. His family is originally from the village of Ighil Ouantar, in the Seddouk District of Béjaïa.\n\nClub career\n\nFrance \nChalali began his career with CA Romainville before he was scouted in summer 2003 from Le Havre AC. He made his Ligue 2 debut on 2 November 2007, coming on as a substitute against EA Guingamp. On 15 July 2009 he agreed a contract with LB Châteauroux.\n\nGreece \nOn 23 August 2010, Chalali signed a three-year contract with Greek club Panionios, joining them on a free transfer from Châteauroux. He made 12 league appearances for the club, 5 of which were as substitute.\n\nScotland \nThe 2011 Greek riots motivated Chalali to seek a move abroad, and former Rangers defender and fellow Algerian Majid Bougherra recommended that he consider playing in Scotland. On 23 August 2011, Chalali signed for Scottish Premier League club Aberdeen. He had been recommended to Aberdeen manager Craig Brown by former Super League Greece colleague Youl Mawene, and had impressed during a trial earlier in the same month. Brown said Chalali had been the most impressive of all the trialists at the club in the 2011 summer transfer window, including Icelandic international Kari Arnason and former Dutch under-21 Maceo Rigters.\n\nOn the same day, despite having gone without sleep the previous evening to return to Greece to retrieve transfer-related paperwork, Chalali made his debut for Aberdeen as a second-half substitute in a 2011–12 Scottish League Cup win against Dundee. He was assigned squad number 18 for the 2011–12 Scottish Premier League season, and made his league debut, also as a substitute, in a 2–0 defeat away to Rangers on 28 August 2011. He made his first start for the club in an Aberdeenshire Cup semi-final fixture against Deveronvale the following day.\n\nHe scored his first goals for the club on 13 September 2011 in a testimonial match against Highland League side Keith, where he got a double and created another in a 6–0 victory. His first league start came in a 2–2 draw against Kilmarnock on 17 September 2011.\nHe scored his first league goal for Aberdeen at Tannadice against Dundee United, scoring the equaliser to make it 1–1, in a game which Aberdeen went on to win 2–1. In the same week he scored his second competitive goal for Aberdeen, in a 4–0 win in the Scottish Cup against Forfar. Near the end of the 2011–12 season, Chalali was advised that his contract with Aberdeen would not be extended.\n\nAlgeria \nOn 10 August 2012, Chalali signed a two-year contract with Algerian Ligue Professionnelle 1 club ES Sétif.\n\nInternational career \nChalali has three caps with the Algerian Under 20 National Team. On 12 October 2010, Chalali made his debut for the Algerian Under-23 National Team in a 1–0 friendly win over Qatar.\n\nHe went on to become captain of the U-23 side. In August 2011, he informed Aberdeen that he was likely to feature in the 2011 CAF U-23 Championship, a tournament that also serves as the qualification process for the 2012 Olympics, and that he had ambitions to represent the full national side in the qualifiers for the 2012 African Cup of Nations. On 16 November 2011, he was selected as part of Algeria's squad for the 2011 CAF U-23 Championship in Morocco.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Mohamed Chalali profile at Aberdeen F.

        "\"Milk\" is a song written and produced by American alternative rock band Garbage from their self-titled debut studio album (1995). The song was released internationally the following year as the album's fifth and final single. Garbage collaborated with English trip hop musician Tricky on a new version of \"Milk\" for single release. Much media comment was made regarding a rumoured fall-out over the sessions, when it became known that Garbage produced a further mix of \"Milk\" that only incorporated Tricky's vocals from that session.\n\nAfter an acclaimed live performance of the new recording of \"Milk\" at the 1996 MTV Europe Music Awards, as well as winning the Best Breakthrough Act, \"Milk (The Wicked Mix feat. Tricky)\" debuted at number 10 on the UK Singles Chart, outselling the previous single \"Stupid Girl\". A mix that deleted Tricky's vocal, \"Milk (The Siren mix)\", charted in Germany, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn North America, \"Milk\" was released alongside album cut \"Supervixen\" as part of a dual-single strategy to build upon the momentum built from the success of previous single \"Stupid Girl\". The single release was supported by Garbage's support slot for the Smashing Pumpkins Infinite Sadness arena tour and pre-empted the release of a home video compilation of all the band's music videos. Both \"Milk\" and \"Supervixen\" failed to chart when alternative radio chose to heavily support their soundtrack feature \"#1 Crush\" instead.\n\nBackground\n\"Milk\" was written and recorded by the band at their own recording studio in Madison, Wisconsin during the 1994–95 sessions for Garbage, and was the first track that Shirley Manson wrote from scratch. Guitarist Duke Erikson had happened to walk past Manson as she strummed an acoustic guitar in their studio lounge. He thought the melody she was humming was interesting and took the idea to the rest of the band: Steve Marker and drummer Butch Vig. Within an hour, they had set up a mic in the control room, Vig programmed some drum loops, Marker played bass and Erikson fired up the mellotron. Shirley's vocal (aside from overdubs) was recorded in a single take facing the control room speakers. The main body of the song was recorded in 45 minutes. At a later point, Garbage recorded some ambient textures for the track, and even had a clarinet part recorded, but these were ultimately removed in favour of keeping the production simple. \"It just had a really beautiful kind of feeling to it\", explained Manson, \"We tried to recreate it in the booth, but it just sounded flat.\" Vig elaborated: \"When it came to mix, we just left it the way we had [originally] recorded it\".\n\nManson had told the rest of the band [when she joined Garbage] that she was a songwriter, but the truth was that she had little input in the songwriting team that formed the core of her previous band: \"As the lead singer, I was left most of the time with coming up with the melody and the licks,\" Manson remembered, \"\"Milk\" was obviously augmented by the rest of Garbage, but the melody and the words are mine\". She was inspired by a line in Michael Ondaatje's The Collected Works of Billy the Kid (\"her throat is a kitchen\") and alluded to it in her lyrics for the song.  Manson later described the composition was \"a seduction, almost like a siren song\", \"I really like the vulnerable and sinister side of \"Milk\". It sounds like it's an innocuous love song and it's not\" and again elaborated further: \"It's been dismissed by people as the ballad at the end of the album. To me \"Milk\" is the darkest, most hopeless of the songs. People say \"Oh, it's lovey-dovey, so therefore it's a love song\". But it's a very bleak song, it's about loss and the fear of loss; about things you can't have and things you will forever wait for.\"\n\nRemix collaboration\nAfter Garbage's fifth single \"Stupid Girl\" had been released internationally, the band's record label were considering what the follow-up single would be; at one point \"Supervixen\", \"Fix Me Now\", and \"Milk\" were all considered. The band performed a headline concert at New York City's Roseland Ballroom in mid-April 1996 and were joined at the aftershow by English trip hop musician Tricky. The two groups hung out for the night, and decided to collaborate on a duet version of \"Milk\" featuring both Manson and Tricky on vocals. In May, the two acts spent a session in Chicago's CRC Studios working on the new recording. The session was setback with numerous glitches including a malfunctioning tape machine and a mixing console caught fire. Manson found the experience of working with a male vocalist \"enchanting and illuminating\". Tricky turned off all the lights in the vocal booth and pressed his mic against Manson's as they performed their parts.\n\nInternet rumors abounded that the session had been a disaster, with the band's audio engineer claiming the results were not as expected, and that Tricky himself had been difficult to work with. The band's manager disputed the reported events, placing blame on problems at the recording studio. The band eventually put out a press statement to deny the rumours stating that the session had in fact gone well, the rework of \"Milk\" was still a work in progress and that further production by both Tricky and Garbage was required. Tricky finished his duet version of \"Milk\" in New York's Platinum Island Studios; Garbage completed their own guitar-led version of \"Milk\" in Madison during a break in their world tour. Garbage's rework was finished in two versions; the first was titled the Siren mix and featured only Manson's vocal; the second also incorporated Tricky's vocal and was titled the Wicked mix. Tricky took exception to Garbage releasing their own version as a single instead of his, and complained about the situation to the press.\n\nRelease\n\"Milk\" was first released as a single in Australia and New Zealand by Mushroom Records imprint label White. The single was released on October 7, 1996, on CD and cassette single and featured the Siren mix as the A-side, and was backed up with the Wicked mix, Tricky's remix and the original album version. The single coincided with the band's first live dates in both countries, which saw the release of a tour edition of the album reach number four on the ARIA chart and number one on the RIANZ chart. Garbage made their first televised performance on Australian television on Hey Hey It's Saturday performing the single. A second \"Milk\" CD single was subsequently issued to stores containing the B-side \"Alien Sex Fiend\", the band's own house mix of \"Dog New Tricks\", and remixes of \"Milk\", \"Stupid Girl\" and \"Queer\" by Rabbit In the Moon, Todd Terry and Danny Saber respectively. \"Milk\" debuted at number 48 on the Australian Singles Chart in early November 1996; the single then re-entered the chart in December and peaked at number 44. In New Zealand, \"Milk\" spent a single week at number 50.\n\nThe Wicked remix of \"Milk\" featuring Tricky impacted UK radio stations in mid-October 1996 and was A-listed by both BBC Radio 1 and Virgin Radio. \"Milk\" subsequently reached number 19 on the airplay chart. Mushroom pre-empted the UK release of \"Milk\" by issuing three limited \"taster\" 12-inch singles through HMV stores in late October; the actual commercial release was on November 11. Two CD singles and a limited-edition 7-inch vinyl were distributed to stores, each featuring the Wicked mix, and with remixes of \"Milk\" by Massive Attack, Goldie, Tricky and Rabbit in The Moon, and remixes of \"Stupid Girl\" by Danny Saber and Todd Terry spread across the formats. The 14,000 copy limited edition 7-inch vinyl format came housed in a white ripple-effect card sleeve, with a videogram image mounted on front, and a nine-panel white and blood red poster within. During the week of release, Garbage won the Best Breakthrough Act award and performed \"Milk\" live at the MTV Europe Music Awards in London. \"Milk\" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number 10, becoming the band's second top-10 entry on the chart. To mark the high position, Garbage performed a live videolink performance of the song from Atlanta for broadcast on Top of The Pops. \"Milk\" spent eight weeks on the UK charts, and sold over 135,000 copies.\n\nAcross Europe, \"Milk\" received heavy support from radio, peaking at number three on Music & Medias Alternative Rock chart in December and climbing to number 24 on the European Top 50 airplay chart by January. Bertelsmann Music Group released two CD singles for \"Milk\", backed with remixes, to record stores. In Germany, modest sales of \"Milk\" led to a seven-week run on their singles chart, peaking at number 84.\n\nIn North America, Almo Sounds enacted a dual-single release strategy; \"Supervixen\" would go to alternative radio, followed by \"Milk\" at Triple A radio stations However, only \"Milk\" would be commercially released to retail, a cassette single initially, followed by the CD single a week later, both backed with the new versions and a Rabbit in the Moon remix. On November 18, Almo serviced additional Rabbit in the Moon mixes to nightclubs. The single sales of \"Milk\" posted a modest number-18 entry on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, which ranks the most popular songs in the United States that have yet to enter the Hot 100.\n\nThe chart impact of both singles was curtailed by the late October impact of a new remix of \"#1 Crush\" (from William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet: Music from the Motion Picture) on Capitol Records, which alternative stations quickly added, dropping \"Supervixen\" almost immediately from their playlists throughout the country. As the soundtrack was not on their label, Almo refused to support \"#1 Crush\" and were adamant on making \"Milk\" a hit. Despite this resistance, in January 1997, \"#1 Crush\" hit number one on the alternative charts in both the United States and Canada; and gain modest traction at Top 40 radio. Despite not gaining much traction at radio, commercial sales of \"Milk\" enabled the single to re-enter the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart at number 15 and peak a week later at number six and hanging on until at the end of February.\n\nMusic video\nThe music video for \"Milk\" was shot in London by director Stéphane Sednaoui. Originally scheduled to shoot in Paris while the band were in France on tour, it was more-cost effective to relocate the shoot to the UK and fly the band over and back. Two edits were completed: a single-take version for the album mix and a second version with some extra shots of Shirley for the Wicked/Siren mix.\n\nIn the United States, VH1 added the \"Milk\" video to its playlist from November 11, MTV following suit. a week later. In December, MTV Europe certified the video a Buzz Bin clip.\n\nThe single-take album version \"Milk\" video was first commercially released on 1996's Garbage Video VHS and Video-CD. A remastered version (a hybrid of the footage from the remix dubbed with the album version) was included on Garbage's 2007 greatest hits DVD Absolute Garbage.\n\nRemixes\nDavid Christophere, who produced under the name of Rabbit in the Moon, was solicited to remix Garbage by Butch Vig himself, through DJ Jason Bentley, after hearing Christophere's work on Sarah McLachlan's \"Fear\". He remixed \"Milk\", which was his preferred choice, after completing remixes of both \"Queer\" and \"Stupid Girl\". Christophere produced two versions of \"Milk\"; one downtempo (\"Butchered Vegas mix\"), and one in a club style (\"Got It mix\"), utilizing Manson's breathing vocal track over a house beat inspired by Deep Dish. Christophere sampled sounds from various sources, such as Pink Floyd, Kraftwerk, Madonna, Plastikman, Portishead and musical cues from Monty Python and Halloween in his mixes.\n\n\"Milk\" was the first major remix project undertaken by Massive Attack in four years. One of their mixes, the \"D Mix\" featured a 22-piece live orchestra.\n\nIn the three weeks before the commercial release of \"Milk\", Mushroom distributed to HMV stores a three-part 12-inch vinyl set as a \"taster release\". These were limited to 500 copies each and were packaged in a die-cut embossed card sleeve (one leather look, one gravel, one rippled), each with a different Dayglo colour inner jacket to identify which mix it is. In May 1997, Mushroom pressed a set of four remix 12-inch vinyl (one each of \"Queer\" and \"Stupid Girl\", and two of \"Milk\") to record stores in plain black card sleeves. The first \"Milk\" 12-inch featured three remixes by Massive Attack and the second featured the two Goldie mixes.\n\nIn 2007, \"Milk\" was remastered and included on Garbage's greatest hits album Absolute Garbage. In 2015, \"Milk\", the Tricky remix, both Wicked and Siren mixes, and nine club remixes were remastered and released on Garbage (20th Anniversary Super Deluxe Edition). The digital bundle also included the previously unreleased \"Primal mix\" by Massive Attack.\n\nCritical reception\nIn a review of the debut album for Kerrang!, Paul Rees called \"Milk\" an \"elegant hymn\", adding that \"impressive and evocative of Ridley Scott's vision of the dark, decaying cityscape of future Los Angeles in Blade Runner. A year later, the same publication reviewed the \"Wicked Mix\", stating \"a bristling, brilliant reworking of the album track... an inspired fusion. Deep blue shuddering beats and a guitar sound so chilled out it's virtually refrigerated.\" Jackie Hayden, in an album review for Hot Press, told readers to \"pay attention to the \"Strawberry Fields Forever\"-keyboards which float in to make fleeting appearances\". RASP! magazine declared the track the album's highlight, writing \"\"Milk\", a song SexKylie would die for, is an indie-\"Confide In Me\" that soars ever upward in its frosty majesty\". In their album review, The Guardian wrote, \"Manson gives her dreamy all on this one, an unbearably lovely, lush ballad. \"A divinely spooked, penumbral beauty\", wrote Sharon O'Connell in her Melody Maker album write-up, \"[\"Milk\" recalls] Julee Cruise's work with Angelo Badalamenti\". \"Depeche Mode in a pensive mood\" wrote Emma Morgan in her NME review, while her colleague M.B.'s write-up for their sister-title Vox described \"Milk\" as \"a stoners midnight Manhattan taxi tour\". Pippa Lang, in a review for Metal Hammer, referred to the subtle strain of sadness within songs such as \"A Stroke of Luck\" and \"Milk\", describing them as \"beautifully melancholic pieces of trancey tragedy\".\n\nTrack listings\n\n Australian CD and cassette White D1380/C1380 \"Milk – The Siren mix\" – 4:02\n \"Milk – The Wicked mix\" (featuring Tricky) – 4:02\n \"Milk – The Tricky mix\" – 4:19\n \"Milk – album version\" – 3:52\n Australian CD2 White D1519 \"Milk – Rabbit In the Moon mix – 5:49\n \"Stupid Girl – Tee's Radio mix\" – 3:45\n \"Queer – Danny Saber mix – 5:39\n \"Dog New Tricks – The Pal mix\" – 4:02\n \"Alien Sex Fiend\" – 4:37\n UK 12-inch taster (Rabbit In the Moon) Mushroom DJMILK1 \"Milk – Got It mix – 9:32\n \"Milk – Butchered Vegas mix – 5:49\n \"Milk – Utter edit – 4:23\n UK 12-inch taster (Goldie) Mushroom DJMILK2 \"Milk – VIP Rufige Trash Your Shit mix\" – 7:38\n \"Milk – Completely Trashed mix\" – 6:31\n UK 12-inch taster (Massive Attack) Mushroom DJMILK3 \"Milk – Trance mix\" – 7:47\n \"Milk – D mix\" – 4:50\n\n UK 7-inch single Mushroom Records SX1494 \"Milk – The Wicked mix\" (featuring Tricky) – 4:02\n \"Milk – The Tricky mix\" – 4:19\n UK CD1 Mushroom Records D1494 \"Milk – The Wicked Mix\" (featuring Tricky) – 4:02\n \"Milk – Completely Trashed mix\" – 6:31\n \"Milk – album version\" – 3:52\n \"Stupid Girl – Tee's radio mix\" – 3:45\n UK CD2 Mushroom Records DX1494 \"Milk – The Wicked mix\" (featuring Tricky) – 4:02\n \"Milk – Classic remix\" – 4:47\n \"Milk – Udder remix\" – 4:49\n \"Stupid Girl – Danny Saber remix\" – 4:26\n US CD and cassette Almo Sounds AMSDS-89007/AMSCS-89007 \"Milk – album version\" – 3:52\n \"Milk – The Siren mix\" – 4:02\n \"Milk – Udder remix\" – 4:49\n \"Milk – The Wicked mix\" (featuring Tricky) – 4:02\n\n Europe CD1 BMG 74321 42322 2 \"Milk – The Siren mix\" – 4:02\n \"Milk – Completely Trashed mix\" – 6:31\n \"Milk – album version\" – 3:52\n \"Stupid Girl – Tee's radio mix\" – 3:45\n Europe CD2 BMG 74321 44018 2 \"Milk – The Siren mix\" – 4:02\n \"Milk – Classic remix\" – 4:47\n \"Milk – Udder remix\" – 4:49\n \"Milk – The Wicked mix\" (featuring Tricky) – 4:02\n UK 12-inch (Milk Remixes) Mushroom TRASH14 \"Milk – VIP Rufige Trash Your Shit mix\" – 7:38\n \"Milk – Completely Trashed mix\" – 6:31\n UK 12-inch (Milk Remixes) Mushroom TRASH14'\n \"Milk – Classic remix\" – 4:47\n \"Milk – Trance mix\" – 7:47\n \"Milk – D mix\" – 4:50\n\nCredits and personnel\n\n Music: Garbage\n Lyrics: Garbage\n Produced: Garbage\n Performed & mixed: Garbage\n 2nd engineer: Mike Zirkel\n\n Vocals : Shirley Manson\n Keyboards : Duke Erikson\n Samples & loops: Steve Marker\n Drums : Butch Vig\n Bass: Mike Kashou\n Recorded at Smart Studios, Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nCharts\n\nWeekly charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nRelease history\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n\n1990s ballads\n1995 songs\n1996 singles\nGarbage (band) songs\nMusic videos directed by Stéphane Sednaoui\nSong recordings produced by Butch Vig\nTorch songs\nSongs written by Shirley Manson\nSongs written by Duke Erikson\nSongs written by Steve Marker\nSongs written by Butch Vig",

        "The Minore Mafia clan was a historical Sicilian Mafia clan originating from the city of Castellammare del Golfo on Sicily's west coast. It was probably founded sometime at the start of the 20th century, it later came to control the city of Trapani and held considerable influence throughout the entire province, and also in Palermo and Catania. They historically maintained good relations with the Buccellato Mafia clan, which also hailed from Castellammare del Golfo.\n\nHistory and notable members \nThe first recorded mention of the clan is from the 1910s, when Salvatore Minore, nicknamed \"Don Totò\", was named as a powerful mafioso in the city. Minore's sister Elisabetta married Salvatore Maranzano, who would later emigrate to the United States and become an important figure within the American Mafia.\n\nThe best known members of the clan, however, are the Minore brothers and cousins who took control of the city of Trapani in the 1950s, taking over from Andrea Fazio. The boss thus became Antonio Salvatore Minore, commonly known as Totò Minore, who controlled the city and held great sway over the province together with his brothers Giovanni, Calogero, Giuseppe and Giacomo. Totò Minore, who was already well known to law enforcement and was banished as part of the \"soggiorno obbligato\" measure to the island of Ustica in 1948 for five years. Calogero Minore was considered the peacemaker of the family for his ability to mediate disputes in the region, and was tied to Mazara boss Leonardo Bonafede. The Minore clan went on to form a very strong alliance with the Buccellato Mafia clan, which like the Minores hailed from Castellammare del Golfo, and eventually came to control that city. Totò Minore was one of the mafiosi present at the 1957 Palermo Mafia summit with American crime boss Joe Bonanno. In 1966, Totò Minore emigrated to the United States and linked up to the Gambino family, opening up a series of pizzerias that were used as a front for narcotics trafficking. He also traveled to Libya, Brazil (where he owned a hotel) and Argentina (once with future Mafia pentito Tommaso Buscetta), and was involved in a large money laundering operation in mainland Italy and in the province of Trapani itself.\n\nTotò Minore developed very close ties to the province of Catania. In 1960, he was the godfather at the baptism of the son of Giuseppe Calderone, the Mafia boss of Catania. Minore was also in business relations with Carmelo Costanzo, dubbed one of \"the four horsemen of the Mafia apocalypse\" by journalist Pippo Fava. According to pentito Antonino Calderone, Minore was a family friend of Carmelo Costanzo and his other relatives, and some \"men of honor\" who were forced to leave the province of Trapani due to police attention were employed at the Costanzo facilities under Minore's direction. Both Totò and Calogero Minore came to own two hundred hectares of land each near Trapani, which were frequently used for Mafia summits and hiding fugitives, and they owned many businesses in and around the city, including tourism facilities, vehicle dealerships, cooperatives, and most importantly the city's banks.\n\nBoth the Minore and Buccellato clan developed a fierce rivalry with the Rimi Mafia clan over the course of the 1970s, and in turn with the Mafia family of Cinisi headed by Gaetano Badalamenti, who was related to the Rimis by marriage. The Minore and Buccellato clans resented the Rimis' strong links with the Palermitan families, and when Badalamenti was in power he even warned Minore against going to the province of Palermo under the threat of death. The emerging Corleonesi Mafia clan at this point backed the Minores and Buccellatos against the Rimis and Badalamentis in their quest to isolate the Palermo families. But while such threats of violence and other acts of hostility abounded, the rivalry never developed into a proper war.\n\nThe Minore clan was involved in a controversy in the late 1970s with the prosecutor of Trapani, Giangiacomo Ciaccio Montalto. Montalto was investigating Mafia activities in the city and province and scrutinized the Minore's many illegal dealings, including several kidnappings in the area such as the fake kidnapping of the businessman Rodittis and the kidnapping and murder of Luigi Corleo, the father-in-law of Nino Salvo. Montalto even ordered an exhumation of the elder brother Giovanni, who had died of natural causes, something which caused great resentment against him by the clan. Montalto issued an arrest warrant for Totò Minore in 1979 for weapons trafficking, and from then on the boss of Trapani and his brother lived as fugitives. Ciaccio Montalto would eventually be murdered in January 1983, and for a long time police suspected Totò Minore of being the organizer, although it later came to light that the murder was carried out by the Corleonesi and saw no involvement from the Minore clan.\n\nDecline \nThe Minore and Buccellato clans had been close to the Corleonesi clan of Totò Riina prior to the outbreak of the Second Mafia War. Nevertheless, as the war began, Riina saw them as unreliable due to their insistence on being neutral and most importantly, he was eager to weaken the two clans to reward his main allies in the province: Francesco Messina Denaro from Castelvetrano, Mariano Agate from Mazara del Vallo and Vincenzo Virga from Trapani.\n\nOn 20 November 1982, Totò Minore, Nicolò Miceli, Martino Buccellato from Castellammare del Golfo and Vincenzo Palazzolo from Cinisi were summoned to a meeting in Palermo by the boss of Partanna-Mondello, Rosario Riccobono. There, on the orders of Totò Riina, the four were strangled and their bodies made to disappear, a practice colloquially known as lupara bianca. News of the massacre did not emerge in mainstream media until 1998, when Calogero Ganci, son of Raffaele Ganci and one of the killers of Totò Minore, confessed to police. Underworld legend goes that Totò Minore's severed head, on Riina's orders, was delivered to his relatives as a warning. Ironically, this would be Rosario Riccobono's last betrayal on behalf of the Corleonesi, as the boss of Partanna-Mondello himself would be murdered in similar circumstances only ten days later, on 30 November. Totò Minore's brother Calogero remained a fugitive until 1986, when he was arrested while hiding in a house in Trapani. He died of natural causes in 1998, before any of his trials had concluded. Many other associates of the Minores were either murdered or forced to step down during the war, and the clan lost all of the power it had accumulated over decades in Sicily, as did the Buccellatos and many other \"old guard\" Mafia clans defeated by the Corleonesi.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nSicilian Mafia clans",

The sculpture also is sometimes known as Standing Figure (Bone) or Winged Figure.\n\nMoore first conceived the work in 1961.  It is based on a fragment of a bird's breastbone, to which a base and a head were added with plasticine.  A rounded protrusion forms the head, and the figure has a diagonal line at its waist.  The resulting composition resembles a human torso, similar to the Winged Victory of Samothrace.   It had been described as the end point of Moore's investigation of upright figures, which started with Standing Figure (1950) (LH 290).  He used a similar process, starting with bone fragments, for his 1962 work, Knife Edge Two Piece.\n\nThe sculpture was enlarged in three stages.  First, Moore made a  high working model (LH 481) in 1961.  The Henry Moore Foundation at Perry Green, Hertfordshire, has two versions, one in plaster and another in fibreglass, and other examples are held by the Hakone Open-Air Museum in Japan, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington DC.\n\nSecond, Moore made the  high Standing Figure: Knife Edge (LH 482), cast at the Morris Singer art foundry in 1961 in an edition of 7 (6 plus 1 artist's copy).  The artist's copy, cast 0, is displayed in the W.B. Yeats Memorial Garden at St Stephen's Green in Dublin. This piece was restored in 2020. There are other examples at:\n One Maritime Plaza in San Francisco \n Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena (cast 4)\n Minneapolis Sculpture Garden\n Botanischer Garten Grugapark, Essen, Germany\nKreeger Museum, Washington, DC\n\nMoore enlarged the work again to create the  high Large Standing Figure: Knife Edge (LH 482a), cast in 1976 in an edition of 8 (6 plus 2 artist's copies).   The two artists copies, cast 0 and cast 00, are owned by the Henry Moore Foundation, with one displayed in Greenwich Park from 1979 to 2007, and again since 2011.\nThere are other examples at:\n Henie Onstad Kunstsenter, in Hovikodden, Norway (cast 1) \n one at the Stiftung Landis and Gyr, beside Lake Zug in Switzerland (cast 3)\n National Museum of Art, Osaka, Japan \n North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh, North Carolina \n Little Rock, Arkansas\n\nSee also\nList of sculptures by Henry Moore\n\nReferences\n\n  Henry Moore: Writings and Conversations, Henry Moore, pp. 290–291\n\n1961 sculptures\nBronze sculptures\nModernist sculpture\nSculptures by Henry Moore\nOutdoor sculptures in London\nSculptures in the North Carolina Museum of Art",

        "Robert Casey Janssen (born September 17, 1981) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He pitched for two seasons in various levels of the Toronto Blue Jays' minor league organization before his debut in 2006 as a starting pitcher. Janssen was moved to the bullpen as a middle reliever and spot starter from 2007 to 2011, and in 2012 he was put in the closing role. Janssen also played for the Washington Nationals.\n\nHigh school career\nJanssen was born in Orange, California, and raised in Huntington Beach, California, graduating from Fountain Valley High School in Fountain Valley, California. At Fountain Valley, Janssen was a three-year letter winner, and set single-season records at the school for home runs (12), RBIs (44), and triples (5). In his senior season, Janssen also pitched 40 innings with a 2.12 ERA and had 56 strikeouts.\n\nCollege career\nJanssen attended University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where he played college baseball for the UCLA Bruins baseball team. In his first season, Janssen pitched as a fourth starter and long reliever, and held a record of 2–3 with a 5.57 ERA, but excelled in relief appearances, and also went 2–9 with a home run as a pinch hitter. In his second season, Janssen played first base and was a starter, finishing the season with a 4.06 ERA and a strikeout-walk ratio of 2.0 before an injury prematurely ended his season. During his junior season, Janssen went 6–6 with a 5.88 ERA and 73 strikeouts, while also making appearances at first base and as a designated hitter. Janssen was the number one starter for his senior season, and went 10-4 with a 3.16 ERA.\n\nProfessional career\n\nToronto Blue Jays\n\n2006–2010\n\nThe Toronto Blue Jays selected Janssen out of UCLA in the fourth round of the 2004 draft. He made his professional debut for the Low-A Auburn Doubledays, posting a 3-1 record and 3.48 ERA in 10 games. He split the 2005 season between the Single-A Lansing Lugnuts, the High-A Dunedin Blue Jays, and the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats, recording a cumulative 13-4 record and 2.18 ERA with 136 strikeouts in 148.2 innings of work. He began the 2006 season with the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs.\n\nWhen an injury to A. J. Burnett created an opening in the Blue Jays' rotation, Janssen was promoted from Syracuse and made his major-league debut against the Baltimore Orioles on April 27, 2006.\n\nJanssen won his first two games against the Los Angeles Angels, both times posting solid outings, allowing fewer than three hits over seven innings each.\n\nIn , with multiple injuries to the Blue Jays rotation and bullpen, Janssen made a move to the bullpen and performed very well as the set-up man for interim closer Jeremy Accardo. He led the bullpen in innings pitched, and was second in team saves with six. Janssen established himself as one of the best in the Toronto Blue Jays bullpen as well as in the American League.\n\nJanssen missed the entire 2008 season with a torn labrum. He was expected to make a full recovery and to be ready for Spring Training 2009 either out of the bullpen or as a starter, but suffered a setback and did not make the Opening Day 2009 roster for Toronto. On May 23, 2009, Janssen returned to action facing the Atlanta Braves in interleague play, going 6 innings and giving up 8 hits and 3 earned runs in a 4–3 decision giving him his first loss of the season.\n\nOn June 17, 2009, it was announced that Janssen was placed on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to June 14, with inflammation of his right shoulder.\n\nJanssen made 56 appearances in 2010, garnering a 5–2 record with a 3.67 ERA.\n\n2011–2012\nJanssen had a fantastic season in 2011, recording a 6–0 record with a career-low 2.26 ERA in 55 appearances. Janssen also recorded 2 saves, beginning his transition into the new Blue Jays closer.\n\nOn February 13, 2012, Janssen signed a two-year, $5.9 million extension with the Blue Jays. His deal includes a $4 million club option for 2014. He will earn $2 million in 2012 and $3.9 million in 2013. In arbitration, Janssen asked for $2.2 million, but the Jays countered with $1.8 million. His contract will cover his final arbitration year and his first free-agent year. He was scheduled to have an arbitration hearing the next day.\n\nOn November 16, 2012, Janssen had surgery to repair \"lingering AC joint soreness\". Janssen was voted by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) as the top Blue Jays pitcher of 2012, narrowly edging out Brandon Morrow. On February 5, 2013, manager John Gibbons said that, barring injury, Janssen would have the closer role for the start of the 2013 regular season, over teammate Sergio Santos. Janssen recorded a career-high 22 saves in 2012.\n\n2013–2014\nJanssen opened the 2013 season with 12 consecutive saves before blowing his first save of the season on June 8, against the Texas Rangers. The Blue Jays would come back to win the game 4–3 in 18 innings, the longest game in franchise history (at the time). On August 4, in a game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Janssen earned his 50th career save. He recorded his 30th save of the 2013 season against the Baltimore Orioles on September 14.\n\nJanssen began the 2014 season on the disabled list with a back strain. He was activated off the disabled list on May 11, 2014, after Chris Getz was designated for assignment. Janssen's 10th save of the season came against the Detroit Tigers on June 5. Coming in with two outs in the 9th inning, Janssen needed only one pitch to complete the save, earning his second career one-pitch save and the first in the majors since Jim Johnson did so against the Jays on July 12, 2013. Though he would struggle after the All-Star break, Janssen remained the closer for Toronto for the rest of the 2014 season. He made his final appearance of the season, as well as the final appearance of his tenure with the Blue Jays, on September 28 against the Baltimore Orioles. Janssen pitched in a non-save situation and needed just 6 pitches to retire the side in the 9th inning. He finished the 2014 season with a 3–3 record, 3.94 ERA, 28 strikeouts, and 25 saves in 30 opportunities.\n\nWashington Nationals\nOn February 2, 2015, Janssen signed a one-year contract with the Washington Nationals for the 2015 season, with a mutual option for the 2016 season. He appeared in 48 games for the Nationals in 2015, posting a 2–5 record, 4.95 ERA, and 27 strikeouts in 40 innings pitched. On November 2, 2015, the Nationals declined Janssen's option, making him a free agent.\n\nSan Diego Padres\nOn February 20, 2016, Janssen signed a minor league contract with the San Diego Padres that included an invitation to spring training. He was released on March 24.\n\nBoston Red Sox\nOn June 16, 2016, Janssen signed a minor league contract with the Boston Red Sox. Janssen recorded a 2.87 ERA in 14 appearances between the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox and the Low-A Lowell Spinners before he opted out of his contract and was released on August 7.\n\nAcereros de Monclova\nOn February 21, 2017, Janssen signed with the Acereros de Monclova of the Mexican League. Janssen posted an 0-3 record and 4.30 ERA in 15 appearances for Monclova before he was released on May 16, 2017.\n\nPitching style\nJanssen relies mostly on a four-seam fastball in the 91–93 mph range, and a cutter at 90–91. He also features a sweeping curveball (76–78), a two-seam fastball (low 90s), and a slider (mid-80s). The slider is almost exclusively used against right-handed hitters, with the two-seamer being its replacement against left-handers. Janssen's curveball has become an excellent \"out pitch\"; in 2012, batters hit .128 against it, and its whiff rate was 39%.\n\nJanssen has become an excellent control pitcher, walking only 1.6 batters per 9 innings in 2012. He has emphasized a low walk rate in becoming a successful pitcher: \"I pride myself, as much as I can, in not walking hitters. ... I can live with giving up hits—they're going to happen—but walks are tougher to swallow.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Baseball Almanac\n \n\n1981 births\nLiving people\nAcereros de Monclova players\nAmerican expatriate baseball players in Canada\nAmerican expatriate baseball players in Mexico\nAmerican people of Dutch descent\nAuburn Doubledays players\nDunedin Blue Jays players\nGulf Coast Blue Jays players\nHarrisburg Senators players\nLansing Lugnuts players\nLas Vegas 51s players\nLowell Spinners players\nMajor League Baseball pitchers\nMexican League baseball pitchers\nNew Hampshire Fisher Cats players\nPawtucket Red Sox players\nPotomac Nationals players\nBaseball players from Orange, California\nSyracuse SkyChiefs players\nToronto Blue Jays players\nUCLA Bruins baseball players\nWashington Nationals players\nWisconsin Woodchucks players",

        "Carl Edward Etelman (April 1, 1900 – December 18, 1963) was an American football back and coach. After playing college football at Tufts University in Massachusetts, he played semi-professional football for the independent St Alphonsus Athletic Association from 1924 to 1926. He also played professionally in the American Football League (AFL) and National Football League (NFL) for the Boston Bulldogs and Providence Steam Roller, before returning to the semi-pro ranks with the Fitton Athletic Club, where he spent three seasons. After his playing career, Etelman coached the Whitman High School football team in Massachusetts for 18 years, and also coached the semi-professional Old Town team of Abington for two years.\n\nEarly life and education\nEtelman was born on April 1, 1900, in Fairhaven, Massachusetts. He attended Fairhaven High School and Academy and graduated in 1920. In football, he was team captain as a senior and played the quarterback position, leading the team to several \"big wins with his dramatic passing and running,\" according to The Standard-Times. At five feet eight inches tall, he was nicknamed \"midget\" by his teammates.\n\nIn 1920, Etelman matriculated at Tufts College—now known as Tufts University—where he starred in football, baseball, and basketball. He eventually earned five varsity letters, including three in football. A 1922 article in The Boston Globe wrote, \"Coach Casey's best bet at quarter[back] is Carl Etelman. He is a good general and may be trusted to run the team in an excellent manner and, if need be, reel off many gains himself.\"\n\nOn a play in the 1923 season opener against , Etelman returned a punt and after \"dodging a handful of defenders and bouncing off a couple of others, eventually fought his way into the end zone\" for a touchdown. He collapsed onto the field after reaching the goal line, and it was found that he fractured his ankle and injured his collarbone. He was done for the game, and several newspaper headlines called him out for the year. However, he returned to the starting lineup against Harvard three weeks later with a reinforced special plate and extra strap in his shoe. Stanley Woodard, for the Boston Herald, wrote:\n\nIn the season finale against Massachusetts, Etelman broke his ankle again, but stayed in the game and two plays later kicked a 40-yard field goal, after which he was carried off the field. The field goal was the margin of victory for Tufts. Following the season, he was named all-New England at quarterback and to the all-Eastern team by The New York Times.\n\nEtelman, who was Jewish, was a member of the Phi Epsilon Pi fraternity at Tufts. After graduating from Tufts with a bachelor's degree in 1924, Etelman had graduate studies at Harvard University and Boston University.\n\nProfessional career\nFollowing his graduation from Tufts, Etelman played professional and semi-professional football to stay in shape while coaching the Whitman High School football team. He started with the St Alphonsus Athletic Association, also referred to as the \"Roxbury Club\", in 1924. In their opening game of the 1925 season before 12,000 fans, the Athletic Association won against the Dorchester Town Team 20–0. Etelman's play was described as \"the game's feature.\" The Boston Globe wrote, \n\nPrior to a game against the Fitton Athletic Club in the season finale, The Boston Globe wrote, \"Carl Etelman, whose spectacular work has featured all the St Alphonsus victories this season, will again be at the helm. He is a good punter, a clever passer and one of the best broken field runners ever turned out at Tufts.\"\n\nEtelman played for several teams during the 1926 season. At the beginning of the year, he returned to Fairhaven High School with former teammates to play the New Bedford High School, in the first matchup between the two teams in years; they had previously stopped the rivalry due to a dispute. It was played before a crowd of about 2,000, which was the largest opening day attendance the stadium had received in years. Fairhaven was victorious on a game-winning 23-yard field goal by Etelman. \n\nMost of the crowd had reportedly come to watch him, as he was under contract in the American Football League (AFL) with the Boston Bulldogs. He was one of the \"big names\" on the team, and was their \"signal caller.\" He played in just three games with the Bulldogs, wearing number 5, before returning to the St Alphonsus Athletic Association.\n\nEtelman also played one game during 1926 for the Providence Steam Roller of the National Football League (NFL), coming in as a starter in his only appearance with the team. He wore number 14 with the Steam Roller.\n\nHis final team of 1926 was the Fitton Athletic Club, and he returned to play with them again in 1927, \"turning many a seeming defeat into a victory with his skill and daring.\" He retired in 1928, but made a final return to his playing career in 1929 with Fitton.\n\nCoaching career\nAfter graduating from Tufts, Etelman acquired a position at Whitman High School in Whitman, Massachusetts, as director of physical education and football coach. He served as their head coach for 18 years before serving in World War II. The Boston Globe in October 1935 wrote, \"Carl Etelman, ex-Providence Steamroller backfield wizard, coaches the Whitman High bunch, and has been doing a bang-up job. Whitman was South Shore champion last year, losing but one game, to North Quincy. That tilt was the second game of the 1934 season, and since then, Whitman has gone unbeaten and untied.\"\n\nIn 1928, while serving as head coach for Whitman High School, Etelman also coached the Old Town team of Abington in football. On October 12, 1928, he coached Abington against the Fitton Athletic Club, who he had formerly played for in 1926 and 1927. A game preview in The Boston Globe wrote, \"Then there is the presence of Carl Etelman as coach of Abington team. For two years Etelman was a power in the Fitton backfield ... Now that he is mentor for the Abington outfit, the Fittons will need all their skill and strength to pull out a win.\" In 1929, Etelman left Abington to play for Fitton, but returned to Abington in 1930 as their head coach.\n\nPersonal life and death\nEtelman was married to Idyla Etelman, with whom he had two children. His brother-in-law, Benjamin D. Gould, also attended Tufts and was a mayor of Vergennes, Vermont.\n\nFrom 1945 until his death in 1963, he worked as a sales manager for Ward Machinery Co. of Brockton, Massachusetts. He was also involved in several civic endeavors, serving as a member of Puritan and Ezra Lodges, the finance chairman of the local Republican Party, chairman of the Temple Israel Hebrew School, and director of several youth camps.\n\nEtelman died on December 18, 1963, in Boston, Massachusetts, after a long illness. He was 63 at the time of his death.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n1900 births\n1963 deaths\nPeople from Fairhaven, Massachusetts\nAmerican football quarterbacks\nAmerican football running backs\nBoston Bulldogs (AFL) players\nProvidence Steam Roller players\nTufts Jumbos baseball players\nTufts Jumbos football players\nTufts Jumbos men's basketball players\nHigh school football coaches in Massachusetts\nCoaches of American football from Massachusetts\nPlayers of American football from Massachusetts\nBaseball players from Bristol County, Massachusetts\nBasketball players from Massachusetts\n20th-century American Jews\nJewish American sportspeople\nBusinesspeople from Massachusetts\nMassachusetts Republicans",

        "Maha Yazawin Thit (, ; ; also known as Myanmar Yazawin Thit or Yazawin Thit) is a national chronicle of Burma (Myanmar). Completed in 1798, the chronicle was the first attempt by the Konbaung court to update and check the accuracy of Maha Yazawin, the standard chronicle of the previous Toungoo Dynasty. Its author Twinthin Taikwun Maha Sithu consulted several existing written sources, and over 600 stone inscriptions collected from around the kingdom between 1783 and 1793. It is the first historical document in Southeast Asia compiled in consultation with epigraphic evidence.\n\nThe chronicle updates the events up to 1785, and contains several corrections and critiques of earlier chronicles. However, the chronicle was not well received, and ultimately rejected by the king and the court who found the critiques of earlier chronicles excessively harsh. It became known as A-pe-gan Yazawin (, the \"Discarded Chronicle\").\n\nNonetheless, when Hmannan Yazawin, the first officially accepted chronicle of Konbaung Dynasty, appeared in 1832, it had incorporated many of Yazawin Thit's corrections, in particular regnal dates of Pagan period kings. Modern scholarship notes the chronicle's innovative use of epigraphy but does not find the chronicle's criticisms harsh. Rather, scholarship maintains that for its criticisms and corrections, the chronicle largely retains traditional narratives, and \"was —as elsewhere in the world —written with didactic intentions\".\n\nIt remains one of the lesser known chronicles today.\n\nThe name\nThe chronicle is sometimes reported as Myanma Yazawin Thit, lit. the \"New Chronicle of Myanmar\". However, Thaw Kaung, the former Chief Librarian of the Universities Central Library in Yangon, writes that the original name found in the two extant original manuscripts stored at the Central Library is Maha Yazawin Thit, and that the name \"Myanmar\" was inserted in the title in 1968 by the publisher of that edition. Thaw Kaung adds that the 1968 copy was picked up by international scholars who subsequently reported the chronicle under the name of Myanma Yazawin Thit. The name Myanma Yazawin Thit continues to be used in English language works.\n\nBackground\nThe chronicle has its beginnings in a seemingly unrelated royal project. On 24 July 1783, King Bodawpaya issued a royal decree to: (1) collect stone inscriptions from all important monasteries and pagodas around the kingdom, (2) study them to demarcate religious glebe lands from taxable lands, and (3) recast the inscriptions if necessary. He put Twinthin Taikwun Maha Sithu, his former tutor and chief interior minister, and Thetpan Atwinwun Yaza Bala Kyawhtin, another senior minister, in charge of the effort. The two ministers moved hundreds of inscriptions to then capital Amarapura, and began to study them.\n\nThough the purpose of the project was to verify claims to tax-free religious property, Twinthin, a \"learned polymath\", quickly noticed several discrepancies between the dates given in Maha Yazawin, the standard chronicle of the monarchy, and the dates given in the contemporary inscriptions he was examining. (Twinthin had already written a biographic chronicle of King Alaungpaya in 1770.) He reported his early findings to the king. The king, who was interested in reading history and had wanted to update Maha Yazawin, commissioned \"a new chronicle of the realm which would be more in accord with the stone inscriptions\". He appointed Twinthin to write the new chronicle.\n\nOrganization and content\nTwinthin, who may have been writing a chronicle as early as 1782, predating the inscription collection project, began writing the chronicle in earnest after the collection was completed in 1793. He referenced several existing chronicles, inscriptions as well as eigyin and mawgun poems. He completed the new chronicle in 1798 in 15 volumes (fascicles of parabaik paper). He had updated the events to 1785.\n\nYazawin Thit is noted for its novel organization and for its criticisms of earlier chronicles. It is organized by dynasties and periods whereas all the other Burmese chronicles (except Zatadawbon Yazawin) are organized strictly along the linear order of kings. (However, Zata is mainly a list of regnal dates and horoscopes, not a full-fledged national chronicle like Yazawin Thit). Twinthin's choice of organizing along dynastic lines was a notable departure from then prevailing practice. All historians of Theravada Buddhist tradition, (Burmese, Sinhalese and Thai), had treated their kings as cakkavatti universal monarchs, rather than kings who were leaders of national groups.\n\nThough organized differently, the chronicle's content closely followed the narratives of the earlier chronicles. The chronicle however does contain several corrections (most notably, regnal dates of earliest kings) and critiques of the earlier chronicles, especially Maha Yazawin. Twinthin highlighted several inconsistencies and mistakes of the earlier chroniclers, and made no apologies for correcting earlier writers' work.\n\nRejection\nTwinthin's critiques were taken by the court as a criticism of one's elders/ancestors, a behavior highly frowned upon in Burmese culture. Although the king himself had commissioned the chronicle, he did not accept the chronicle when his former tutor presented it to him. The chronicle came to be viewed as the \"antithesis\" to Maha Yazawin's \"thesis\", and became known as A-pe-gan Yazawin (, the \"Discarded Chronicle\").\n\nTwinthin's views are not viewed as harsh by modern academics. Pe Maung Tin notes that Yazawin Thit \"with all its criticisms, on the whole follows the Great Chronicle\" (Maha Yazawin). The author, for all his academic zeal, still \"shared the purpose of early writers to legitimize the dynasty\", and \"had similar priorities in terms of content\" with early chroniclers.\n\nSignificance\nThe chronicle is the first known historical document in Southeast Asia to use epigraphic sources. According to (Woolf 2011), it shows that historians in Southeast Asia were using epigraphy for sourcing and verification around the same time as the practice was first used in Europe, even if Twinthin's methods may not have \"evolved into a formal method\". Woolf continues that \"We should not overstate the 'scientific' character of these works since much Burmese historiography was — as elsewhere in the world — written with didactic intentions.\"\n\nUsing epigraphy, Twinthin updated the regnal dates of earliest Burmese kingdoms. Hmannan, the official chronicle of Konbaung court, would retain nearly all of Twinthin's corrections. The table below shows a comparison of the regnal dates of Pagan Dynasty. Hmannan's dates largely follow Yazawin Thit's.\n\nCurrent status\nFor all its groundbreaking introductions, the chronicle remains one of the \"lesser known\" chronicles today. Moreover, only the first 13 of the total 15 volumes have been found and published. (The Universities Central Library of Myanmar has portions of two original manuscripts of the chronicle. Of the original 15 volumes, only the first 13 volumes, which cover up to 1754, have survived. The 14th volume is believed to be the same as Twinthin's 1770 work, Alaungpaya Ayedawbon, the biographic chronicle of King Alaungpaya, covering up to 1760. It means the last volume, which covers from 1760 to 1785, has not been recovered. The last volume did exist as it was referenced by later Konbaung writers.)\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1798 non-fiction books\n18th-century history books\nBurmese chronicles\nBurmese literature\nHistory of Myanmar\nBurmese Buddhist texts",

        "Zealia Brown-Reed Bishop (1897–1968) was an American writer of short stories. Her name is sometimes spelled \"Zelia.\" Although she mostly wrote romantic fiction, she is remembered for three short horror stories she wrote in collaboration with H. P. Lovecraft.\n\nWorks\nAmong her works are three horror stories she wrote in collaboration with H. P. Lovecraft (\"The Curse of Yig\", \"Medusa's Coil\", and The Mound). Her stories appeared in the magazine Weird Tales.\n\nArkham House published her volume The Curse of Yig (1953) which contains the three horror stories by Bishop and Lovecraft, as well as two profiles by Bishop, one about H. P. Lovecraft and the other about August Derleth. That on Lovecraft has been reprinted in Peter Cannon's collection of essays on Lovecraft, Lovecraft Remembered. The three Lovecraft-Bishop revision stories also appear in The Horror in the Museum and Other Revisions.\n\nBishop's preference was for romantic fiction, of which she wrote and published far more than she did of the weird. She lived in Kansas City with her husband D.W. Bishop, took an active role in the National Federation of Press Women, the New England Historic Genealogical Society and the Missouri Women's Press Club. She authored a historical series about Clay County, Missouri.\n\nLetters from Lovecraft\nIn 2014, a hitherto unknown and unpublished cache of thirty-six letters from Lovecraft to Bishop was discovered. The letters had once been kept in a trunk with her manuscripts at the home of Jeanette Starkweather Cole, with whom Zealia had moved in after the death of her husband D.W. Bishop in 1956 (Clay County, Missouri), The trunk was initially bequeathed to their daughter, Etha Charmaine Cole McCall Fowler (Zealia's great niece). Her son, Sean McCall, found the letters following Mrs Fowler's death in 2014. A large manila envelope holding the letters was from Lovecraft's friend and collaborator, August Derleth, posted in August 1937. The envelope may have been used to return manuscripts of letters which Zealia had sent him following Lovecraft's death. The letters have now been published, with additional illustrative material, by the H. P. Lovecraft Historical Society.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1897 births\n1968 deaths\nAmerican fantasy writers\nAmerican horror writers\nAmerican women short story writers\nWomen science fiction and fantasy writers\nWomen horror writers\nAmerican women novelists\n20th-century American novelists\n20th-century American women writers\n20th-century American short story writers",

        "Scott Eugene Sanders (born 1958) received his commission in May 1980 from the United States Naval Academy and was designated a naval aviator in 1982. After completing training in the E-2C, he reported to the Seahawks of Carrier Airborne Early Warning Squadron (VAW) 126. While at VAW-126, he made deployments to the Mediterranean and Caribbean aboard USS John F. Kennedy.\n\nIn 1986, Sanders returned to VAW-120 as a flight instructor and served as the squadron’s flight standardization officer, E-2C model manager and commander, Naval Air Forces Atlantic E-2C evaluator. He transitioned from active duty in July 1987 and affiliated in the Naval Reserve in a flight status with VAW-78.\n\nSanders held numerous billets at VAW-78 before assuming command of the squadron in November 1997. During his tenure as executive officer and commanding officer, VAW-78 earned the Battle E for excellence (twice), the F. Trubee Davison Award as the top tactical Navy Reserve Squadron, and a Chief of Naval Operations Meritorious Unit Commendation.\n\nIn 1990, Sanders was selected as the Navy Reserve Junior Officer of the Year. Additionally, he held a concurrent billet supporting NATO Reserve Forces from 1992-1998. He was the elected chairman of the commission on NATO’s Standardization and Training of Reserves Forces from 1997-1998.\nSanders was then selected to be commanding officer of Tactical Air Control Squadron 2186 in 1999.

        "Alex Carroll (born March 18, 1992) is a former Canadian football wide receiver. He played for the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League in 2015 and later was a member of the Montreal Alouettes in 2017. He previously attended Queen's University where he played college football for the Golden Gaels and studied political science.\n\nEarly career \n\nCarroll played high school football at Mount Douglas Secondary School. He played for the Queen's Golden Gaels from 2010 to 2014, where he was a receiver, kickoff returner, and punt returner. In 2012, Carroll suffered a severe knee injury in a playoff game against the Guelph Gryphons, tearing his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), lateral meniscus, and medial meniscus. The injury required reconstructive surgery. Carroll was eligible for the 2014 CFL Draft, but was not selected. He subsequently returned to the Gaels for his fifth year of eligibility in 2014, playing in eight games. He finished his final year with 52 receptions for 875 yards and eight touchdowns. Carroll was named a first-team all-star at wide receiver and second-team all-star at kick and punt returner within the Ontario University Athletics (OUA) regional athletics organization.\n\nProfessional career \n\nFollowing his performance during his final season with the Gaels, Carroll was invited to the regional CFL Combine in Edmonton and a mini-camp with the Saskatchewan Roughriders. The Roughriders signed Carroll in late April as an undrafted free agent. He was placed on the practice roster following the preseason. Carroll made his CFL debut against the BC Lions on July 10, playing mostly on the special teams. On August 22, he made his first start as a receiver against the Calgary Stampeders, catching his first CFL pass for 15 yards and a touchdown. He was released by the Roughriders on May 13, 2016.\n\nCarroll signed with the Montreal Alouettes in 2017, but suffered an injury that made him miss the season.\n\nLater life\nAfter his football career, Carroll worked for the real estate business Engel & Völkers.\n\nReferences \n\n1992 births\nLiving people\nCanadian football wide receivers\nCanadian football return specialists\nQueen's Golden Gaels football players\nSaskatchewan Roughriders players\nPlayers of Canadian football from British Columbia\nCanadian football people from Victoria, British Columbia",

        "The Sessions Band is an American musical group that has periodically recorded and toured with American rock singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen in various formations since 1997.\n\nHistory \n\nThe Sessions Band was first formed in October 1997. That September, Springsteen had organized a fiesta-themed party at his Colts Neck, New Jersey farm and invited the New York–based band The Gotham Playboys to provide entertainment. The next month, Springsteen was invited to donate a recording to an upcoming tribute album to folk singer Pete Seeger. He re-contacted the Playboys and some additional musicians whom he knew through E Street Band violinist Soozie Tyrell, and recorded a number of songs on November 2, 1997.  These included \"We Shall Overcome\", which was released on the 1998 tribute album, Where Have All The Flowers Gone: The Songs Of Pete Seeger.\n\nThe group was then disbanded for an extended period. In late 2004, while reviewing material for a possible follow-up to his Tracks box set, Springsteen stumbled upon these recordings and decided to release them as a stand-alone project. There was not enough material, however, so he reformed the band for what would become known as the Second Seeger Session on March 19, 2005. The third and, so far, final Seeger Session took place on January 21, 2006.\n\nOn April 25, 2006, the album was released as We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions (so titled as each of the album's thirteen songs had been previously recorded or performed by Pete Seeger). The subsequent Bruce Springsteen with The Seeger Sessions Band Tour took this musical approach even further, with a travelling group partly composed of musicians from the sessions.  On October 3, 2006, the album was reissued as We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions – American Land Edition with five additional tracks.

After E Street Band organist Danny Federici ceased touring with the band due to melanoma in November 2007, and his subsequent death in April 2008, Sessions Band member Charles Giordano joined the E Street Band for the remainder of the Magic Tour and has been with the band ever since.\n\nOn Springsteen's 2009 Working on a Dream Tour with the E Street Band, Giordano was joined in the touring band by Sessions Band members Cindy Mizelle and Curtis King, who sang backup vocals. Curt Ramm also toured with the E Street Band for much of the final leg of the tour, playing trumpet on select songs. On Springsteen's 2012 Wrecking Ball Tour, Giordano, Mizelle, and King were joined in full-time roles by Ramm on trumpet, Ed Manion on saxophone, and Clark Gayton on trombone. Other members of the band occasionally guested at shows on the Working on a Dream Tour. Sam Bardfeld along with a string section that he fronted, appeared at a few shows on Springsteen's The River Tour 2016. Springsteen has indicated he would like to do another project with the Sessions Band in the future.\n\nOn May 16, 2015, Springsteen reunited with a version of the Sessions Band for a four-song set at the Kristen Ann Carr Fund's \"A Night To Remember\" event in tribute to Thom Zimny at Tribeca Grill in New York City. The band, billed for the evening as the \nTribeca Playboys, consisted of Charles Giordano on accordion, Jeremy Chatzky on upright bass, Larry Eagle on drums, Sam Bardfeld and Soozie Tyrell on fiddle, Losa Lowell on vocals and guitar, Ed Manion on saxophone, and Curt Ramm on trumpet; the group was also joined by guests Nils Lofgren on guitar, Curtis King on vocals, and restaurateur and venue host Drew Nieporent on washboard.\n\nBand members\n\nSeeger Sessions Studio Band \n Bruce Springsteen – lead vocals, guitar, harmonica, B3 organ, and percussion\n Sam Bardfeld – violin\n Art Baron – tuba\n Frank Bruno – guitar\n Jeremy Chatzky – upright bass\n Mark Clifford – banjo\n Larry Eagle – drums and percussion\n Charles Giordano – B3 organ, piano, and accordion\n Ed Manion – saxophone\n Mark Pender – trumpet, backing vocals\n Richie \"La Bamba\" Rosenberg – trombone, backing vocals\n Patti Scialfa – backing vocals\n Soozie Tyrell – violin, backing vocals\n Lisa Lowell-backing vocals\n\nSessions Band (touring band) \nThe band ranged in size from 17 and 20 members on stage, depending upon availability on a given night.

        "West Branch High School is a public high school in Beloit, Ohio, United States. The high school was established in 1960  It is the only high school in the West Branch Local School District. Sports teams are called the Warriors, and they compete in the Ohio High School Athletic Association as a member of the Eastern Buckeye Conference.\n\nHistory \nThe high school was established in 1960\n\nIn June 2001, an outbreak of bacterial meningitis killed two high school students. A third student was hospitalized, but survived.\n\nAthletics\n\nOHSAA State Championships\n\n Football – 1994 \n Girls Basketball – 2004\n\n1994 football championship\nWest Branch entered the playoffs with an undefeated record of 10-0 in the 1994 season and had clinched an NBC league title. West Branch won its first game against Copley by a score of 56-12. In the state semi-final game, the Warriors matched up against perennial powerhouse Steubenville Big Red. After a 21-7 deficit in the first half, the Warriors charged back with 3 consecutive touchdowns leading them to a 31-28 victory and a berth in the state finals. The state finals paired the Warriors against Clyde. West Branch won by a score of 28-11, giving the Northeastern Buckeye Conference its only football state title and West Branch its first state title in Division 3 football.\n\nRivalry with Salem \nWest Branch's football program maintains a rivalry with Salem High School, located about  away. The reason can be traced back to before 1971, when West Branch, without a field at the school, was forced to use Salem's field a home field. Due to this, the games played there were usually intense, and very emotional for the players involved.\n\nThe construction of Clinton Heacock Stadium in 1971 allowed West Branch to play at its own field. However, the rivalry continued to be fierce, with occasional fan fights breaking out.\n\nIn 1994, perhaps the best game of the rivalry was played at Salem. At the end of regulation, the score was tied at 21-21. However, West Branch managed to pull off a stunning 28-21 victory in overtime. This win, coupled with a perfect regular season, started a run through the playoffs which ultimately led to a state championship.\n\nIn 1996, the fighting after the game caused by fans was so intense that the rivalry was called off for two years. In 1998, the rivalry was resumed, with Salem pulling a stunning victory over the Warriors. This win was the last for them until 2005.\n\nThe most recent game in 2021 ended in a 43-42 overtime victory over the Quakers, securing a perfect 10-0 regular season for the Warriors\n\nSalem joined West Branch in the Northeastern Buckeye Conference for the 2011-12 school year, and both schools helped create the Eastern Buckeye Conference in 2018. This both guarantees and expands the rivalry as the Quakers and Warriors will meet yearly in all sports.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n School website\n District website\n\nHigh schools in Mahoning County, Ohio\nPublic high schools in Ohio",

        "The Texas Early Music Project is a performing arts ensemble based in Austin, Texas, that focuses on bringing audiences a closer knowledge and appreciation of Baroque music, Medieval music, Renaissance music, and early Classical-period music. The group uses historical instruments in keeping with historically informed performance practice.  The ensemble was founded in 1987 by Daniel Johnson, who remains the group's artistic director. The group is classified as a non-profit organization (501(c)(3)) and operates primarily on grant money and donations for individual and corporate supporters.  Income is supplemented by ticket sales and merchandise sales. Texas Early Music Project is a member of Early Music America.  Performers are primarily professional musicians from the Austin area, although performers visit from Texas at large, from all over the United States, and occasionally internationally.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Texas Early Music project was initially conceived of as an opportunity for student members of The University of Texas at Austin Early Music Ensemble to work and perform with professional musicians, allowing them to explore a wider repertoire and gain performance experience. Over the years, growing popularity and an increased awareness of early music have led to the group's establishment as a prominent presence in the Austin music community, and the group regularly hosts performances in the Austin area at several different venues.\n\nPerformances\n\nBetween 1995 and 2002, TEMP's orchestra performed in several productions with the UT Opera Theater, including Purcell's Dido and Aeneas, \"Baroque and Loving It\" (a pastiche of selections from the works of Lully, Rameau, Cavalli, Cesti, and others, arranged by conductor Daniel Johnson), Cavalli's L'Ormindo, Monteverdi's Coronation of Poppea, and Handel's Alcina and Rinaldo. TEMP has performed at the Early Music Weekend at Round Top Festival Institute, appears regularly at the Texas Early Music Festival in Palestine, Texas, and contributed a performance to the Mostly Music Marathon (benefiting AIDS Services of Austin).\n\nIn 1998, TEMP became a member of the Austin Circle of Theaters (now the Austin Creative Alliance) and initiated its Midwinter Festival of Music (1998–2002), a series of unique concerts and operas performed over six successive weekends. Local performers and guests from Europe and Canada came together for performances of Handel's Rinaldo and Alcina, Purcell's King Arthur, and other works from the diverse early music repertoire ranging from Hildegard of Bingen's chants to Sephardic love songs to lieder by Schubert and Beethoven.\n\nSince 2003, TEMP has offered audiences a concert season between the months of September and May. Many concert programs are brought back by popular demand in successive seasons, including \"Convivencia: The Three Worlds of Spain\" (repeated in 2004, 2005, and 2010) and \"The Play of Daniel\" (repeated 2003-2005).\n\nMore recently, in 2012, the ensemble performed Hildegard of Bingen's Ordo Virtutum to a sold-out concert hall in downtown Austin.\n\nAwards and honors\n\n2006- Austin Critic's Table - Best Choral Concert for \"Monteverdi's Vespers of the Blessed Virgin, 1610\"\n2005- Austin Critic's Table - Best Choral Concert for \"Pathways to Bach\"\n2003- Austin Critic's Table - Best Chamber Concert for \"Veris Dulcis\"\n2011- Austin Critic's Table - Best Chamber Concert for \"Convivencia: Worlds of Renaissance Spain\"\n\nPast and Current Performers\n\nLaurie Young Stevens, violin, concertmistress\nAbby Green, mezzo-soprano, bouzouki, percussion\nAllison Welch, oboe, alto\nAnnette Bauer, winds, percussion\nBecky Baxter, harp\nBoel Gidholm, Baroque violin & viola, vielle\nBrent Baldwin, baritone\nBrett Barnes, baritone\nBrian Pettey, baritone\nBruce Brogdon, lute, theorbo, guitars\nBruce Colson, violin\nCayla Cardiff, mezzo-soprano\nChristopher Haritatos, Baroque cello\nChristopher LeCluyse, tenor\nDavid Dawson, bass\nDavid Lopez, tenor\nDavid Stevens, tenor\nElaine Barber, harp\nGil Zilkha, bass-baritone\nGitanjali Mathur, soprano\nHeidi Hock Kaim, soprano\nJames Brown, viola da gamba\nJane Leggiero, viola da gamba, Baroque cello\nJeffrey Jones-Ragona, tenor\nJim Garrison, percussion\nJoel Nesvadba, tenor\nJonathan Brumley, lute, keyboard\nJonathan Nesvadba, baritone\nJonathan Riemer, tenor\nJohn Walters, viola da gamba, Baroque cello, mandola, vielle, rebec\nJos Milton, tenor\nJulie Silva, mezzo-soprano, percussion\nKamran Hooshmand, oud, santur\nKaren Burciaga, violin, vielle, viola da gamba\nKathlene Ritch, soprano\nKeith Womer, keyboard\nKit Robberson, vielle, viola da gamba\nLarisa Montanaro, mezzo-soprano\nLisa Alexander, mezzo-soprano\nMeredith Ruduski, soprano\nPeter Lohman, tenor\t\nPhilip Baker, organ, bass\nRebecca Muniz, soprano\nScott Horton, lute, theorbo, guitar, oud\nStephanie Prewitt, mezzo-soprano\nSteven Olivares, bass\nSusan Richter, alto, recorders, shawm\nTemmo Korisheli, tenor\nTherese Honey, harp\nTom Zajac, shawm, sackbut, bagpipe, recorder, percussion\n\nRecordings\n\nThe Texas Early Music Project often release recordings of their live performances.

        "The thorium fuel cycle is a nuclear fuel cycle that uses an isotope of thorium, , as the fertile material. In the reactor,  is transmuted into the fissile artificial uranium isotope  which is the nuclear fuel. Unlike natural uranium, natural thorium contains only trace amounts of fissile material (such as ), which are insufficient to initiate a nuclear chain reaction. Additional fissile material or another neutron source is necessary to initiate the fuel cycle. In a thorium-fuelled reactor,  absorbs neutrons to produce . This parallels the process in uranium breeder reactors whereby fertile  absorbs neutrons to form fissile . Depending on the design of the reactor and fuel cycle, the generated  either fissions in situ or is chemically separated from the used nuclear fuel and formed into new nuclear fuel.\n\nThe thorium fuel cycle has several potential advantages over a uranium fuel cycle, including thorium's greater abundance, superior physical and nuclear properties, reduced plutonium and actinide production, and better resistance to nuclear weapons proliferation when used in a traditional light water reactor though not in a molten salt reactor.\n\nHistory\nConcerns about the limits of worldwide uranium resources motivated initial interest in the thorium fuel cycle.  It was envisioned that as uranium reserves were depleted, thorium would supplement uranium as a fertile material. However, for most countries uranium was relatively abundant and research in thorium fuel cycles waned. A notable exception was India's three-stage nuclear power programme.\nIn the twenty-first century thorium's claimed potential for improving proliferation resistance and waste characteristics led to renewed interest in the thorium fuel cycle. While thorium is more abundant in the continental crust than uranium and easily extracted from monazite as a side product of rare earth element mining, it is much less abundant in seawater than uranium.\n\nAt Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1960s, the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment used  as the fissile fuel in an experiment to demonstrate a part of the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor that was designed to operate on the thorium fuel cycle.  Molten salt reactor (MSR) experiments assessed thorium's feasibility, using thorium(IV) fluoride dissolved in a molten salt fluid that eliminated the need to fabricate fuel elements. The MSR program was defunded in 1976 after its patron Alvin Weinberg was fired.\n\nIn 1993, Carlo Rubbia proposed the concept of an energy amplifier or \"accelerator driven system\" (ADS), which he saw as a novel and safe way to produce nuclear energy that exploited existing accelerator technologies. Rubbia's proposal offered the potential to incinerate high-activity nuclear waste and produce energy from natural thorium and depleted uranium.\n\nKirk Sorensen, former NASA scientist and Chief Technologist at Flibe Energy, has been a long-time promoter of thorium fuel cycle and particularly liquid fluoride thorium reactors (LFTRs). He first researched thorium reactors while working at NASA, while evaluating power plant designs suitable for lunar colonies. In 2006 Sorensen started \"energyfromthorium.com\" to promote and make information available about this technology.\n\nA 2011 MIT study concluded that although there is little in the way of barriers to a thorium fuel cycle, with current or near term light-water reactor designs there is also little incentive for any significant market penetration to occur. As such they conclude there is little chance of thorium cycles replacing conventional uranium cycles in the current nuclear power market, despite the potential benefits.\n\nNuclear reactions with thorium\nIn the thorium cycle, fuel is formed when  captures a neutron (whether in a fast reactor or thermal reactor) to become . This normally emits an electron and an anti-neutrino () by  decay to become . This then emits another electron and anti-neutrino by a second  decay to become , the fuel:\n\n\\overset{neutron}{n}+{^{232}_{90}Th} -> {^{233}_{90}Th} ->[\\beta^-] {^{233}_{91}Pa} ->[\\beta^-] \\overset{fuel}{^{233}_{92}U}\n\nFission product waste\nNuclear fission produces radioactive fission products which can have half-lives from days to greater than 200,000 years. According to some toxicity studies, the thorium cycle can fully recycle actinide wastes and only emit fission product wastes, and after a few hundred years, the waste from a thorium reactor can be less toxic than the uranium ore that would have been used to produce low enriched uranium fuel for a light water reactor of the same power.\nOther studies assume some actinide losses and find that actinide wastes dominate thorium cycle waste radioactivity at some future periods. Some fission products have been proposed for nuclear transmutation, which would further reduce the amount of nuclear waste and the duration during which it would have to be stored (whether in a deep geological repository or elsewhere). However, while the principal feasibility of some of those reactions has been demonstrated at laboratory scale, there is as of 2022 no large scale deliberate transmutation of fission products anywhere in the world and the upcoming MYRRHA research project into transmutation is mostly focused on transuranic waste. Furthermore, the cross section of some fission products is relatively low and others - such as Caesium - are present as a mixture of stable, short lived and long lived isotopes in nuclear waste, making transmutation dependent on extremely expensive isotope separation.\n\nActinide waste\nIn a reactor, when a neutron hits a fissile atom (such as certain isotopes of uranium), it either splits the nucleus or is captured and transmutes the atom. In the case of , the transmutations tend to produce useful nuclear fuels rather than transuranic waste. When  absorbs a neutron, it either fissions or becomes . The chance of fissioning on absorption of a thermal neutron is about 92%; the capture-to-fission ratio of , therefore, is about 1:12 – which is better than the corresponding capture vs. fission ratios of  (about 1:6), or  or  (both about 1:3). The result is less transuranic waste than in a reactor using the uranium-plutonium fuel cycle.\n\n, like most actinides with an even number of neutrons, is not fissile, but neutron capture produces fissile .  If the fissile isotope fails to fission on neutron capture, it produces , , , and eventually fissile  and heavier isotopes of plutonium. The  can be removed and stored as waste or retained and transmuted to plutonium, where more of it fissions, while the remainder becomes , then americium and curium, which in turn can be removed as waste or returned to reactors for further transmutation and fission.\n\nHowever, the  (with a half-life of ) formed via (n,2n) reactions with  (yielding  that decays to ), while not a transuranic waste, is a major contributor to the long-term radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel. While  can in principle be converted back to  by neutron absorption its neutron absorption cross section is relatively low, making this rather difficult and possibly uneconomic.\n\nUranium-232 contamination\n is also formed in this process, via (n,2n) reactions between fast neutrons and , , and :\n\nUnlike most even numbered heavy isotopes,  is also a fissile fuel fissioning just over half the time when it absorbs a thermal neutron.  has a relatively short half-life (), and some decay products emit high energy gamma radiation, such as ,  and particularly . The full decay chain, along with half-lives and relevant gamma energies, is:\n decays to  where it joins the decay chain of \n\nThorium-cycle fuels produce hard gamma emissions, which damage electronics, limiting their use in bombs.  cannot be chemically separated from  from used nuclear fuel; however, chemical separation of thorium from uranium removes the decay product  and the radiation from the rest of the decay chain, which gradually build up as  reaccumulates. The contamination could also be avoided by using a molten-salt breeder reactor and separating the  before it decays into .  The hard gamma emissions also create a radiological hazard which requires remote handling during reprocessing.\n\nNuclear fuel\nAs a fertile material thorium is similar to , the major part of natural and depleted uranium. The thermal neutron absorption cross section (σa) and resonance integral (average of neutron cross sections over intermediate neutron energies) for  are about three and one third times those of the respective values for .\n\nAdvantages\nThe primary physical advantage of thorium fuel is that it uniquely makes possible a breeder reactor that runs with slow neutrons, otherwise known as a thermal breeder reactor. These reactors are often considered simpler than the more traditional fast-neutron breeders. Although the thermal neutron fission cross section (σf) of the resulting  is comparable to  and , it has a much lower capture cross section (σγ) than the latter two fissile isotopes, providing fewer non-fissile neutron absorptions and improved neutron economy. The ratio of neutrons released per neutron absorbed (η) in  is greater than two over a wide range of energies, including the thermal spectrum. A breeding reactor in the uranium–plutonium cycle needs to use fast neutrons, because in the thermal spectrum one neutron absorbed by  on average leads to less than two neutrons.\n\nThorium is estimated to be about three to four times more abundant than uranium in Earth's crust, although present knowledge of reserves is limited. Current demand for thorium has been satisfied as a by-product of rare-earth extraction from monazite sands. Notably, there is very little thorium dissolved in seawater, so seawater extraction is not viable, as it is with uranium. Using breeder reactors, known thorium and uranium resources can both generate world-scale energy for thousands of years.\n\nThorium-based fuels also display favorable physical and chemical properties that improve reactor and repository performance. Compared to the predominant reactor fuel, uranium dioxide (), thorium dioxide () has a higher melting point, higher thermal conductivity, and lower coefficient of thermal expansion. Thorium dioxide also exhibits greater chemical stability and, unlike uranium dioxide, does not further oxidize.\n\nBecause the  produced in thorium fuels is significantly contaminated with  in proposed power reactor designs, thorium-based used nuclear fuel possesses inherent proliferation resistance.  cannot be chemically separated from  and has several decay products that emit high-energy gamma radiation. These high-energy photons are a radiological hazard that necessitate the use of remote handling of separated uranium and aid in the passive detection of such materials.\n\nThe long-term (on the order of roughly  to ) radiological hazard of conventional uranium-based used nuclear fuel is dominated by plutonium and other minor actinides, after which long-lived fission products become significant contributors again. A single neutron capture in  is sufficient to produce transuranic elements, whereas five captures are generally necessary to do so from . 98–99% of thorium-cycle fuel nuclei would fission at either  or , so fewer long-lived transuranics are produced. Because of this, thorium is a potentially attractive alternative to uranium in mixed oxide (MOX) fuels to minimize the generation of transuranics and maximize the destruction of plutonium.\n\nDisadvantages\nThere are several challenges to the application of thorium as a nuclear fuel, particularly for solid fuel reactors:\n\nIn contrast to uranium, naturally occurring thorium is effectively mononuclidic and contains no fissile isotopes; fissile material, generally ,  or plutonium, must be added to achieve criticality. This, along with the high sintering temperature necessary to make thorium-dioxide fuel, complicates fuel fabrication. Oak Ridge National Laboratory experimented with thorium tetrafluoride as fuel in a molten salt reactor from 1964 to 1969, which was expected to be easier to process and separate from contaminants that slow or stop the chain reaction.\n\nIn an open fuel cycle (i.e. utilizing  in situ), higher burnup is necessary to achieve a favorable neutron economy. Although thorium dioxide performed well at burnups of 170,000 MWd/t and 150,000 MWd/t at Fort St. Vrain Generating Station and AVR respectively, challenges complicate achieving this in light water reactors (LWR), which compose the vast majority of existing power reactors.\n\nIn a once-through thorium fuel cycle, thorium-based fuels produce far less long-lived transuranics than uranium-based fuels,\nsome long-lived actinide products constitute a long-term radiological impact, especially  and . On a closed cycle, and  can be reprocessed.  is also considered an excellent burnable poison absorber in light water reactors.\n\nAnother challenge associated with the thorium fuel cycle is the comparatively long interval over which  breeds to . The half-life of  is about 27 days, which is an order of magnitude longer than the half-life of . As a result, substantial  develops in thorium-based fuels.  is a significant neutron absorber and, although it eventually breeds into fissile , this requires two more neutron absorptions, which degrades neutron economy and increases the likelihood of transuranic production.\n\nAlternatively, if solid thorium is used in a closed fuel cycle in which  is recycled, remote handling is necessary for fuel fabrication because of the high radiation levels resulting from the decay products of . This is also true of recycled thorium because of the presence of , which is part of the  decay sequence. Further, unlike proven uranium fuel recycling technology (e.g. PUREX), recycling technology for thorium (e.g. THOREX) is only under development.\n\nAlthough the presence of  complicates matters, there are public documents showing that  has been used once in a nuclear weapon test. The United States tested a composite -plutonium bomb core in the MET (Military Effects Test) blast during Operation Teapot in 1955, though with much lower yield than expected.\n\nAdvocates for liquid core and molten salt reactors such as LFTRs claim that these technologies negate thorium's disadvantages present in solid fuelled reactors. As only two liquid-core fluoride salt reactors have been built (the ORNL ARE and MSRE) and neither have used thorium, it is hard to validate the exact benefits.\n\nThorium-fueled reactors\n\nThorium fuels have fueled several different reactor types, including light water reactors, heavy water reactors, high temperature gas reactors, sodium-cooled fast reactors, and molten salt reactors.\n\nList of thorium-fueled reactors\n\nFrom IAEA TECDOC-1450 \"Thorium Fuel Cycle – Potential Benefits and Challenges\", Table 1: Thorium utilization in different experimental and power reactors.

        "Mark Gertler (born Marks Gertler; 9 December 1891 – 23 June 1939) was a British painter of figure subjects, portraits and still-life. \n\nHis early life and his relationship with Dora Carrington were the inspiration for Gilbert Cannan's novel Mendel. The characters of Loerke in D. H. Lawrence's Women in Love, and Gombauld in Aldous Huxley's Crome Yellow were based on him.\n\nEarly life \n\nMarks Gertler was born on 9 December 1891 in Spitalfields, London, the youngest child of Polish Jewish immigrants, Louis Gertler and Kate \"Golda\" Berenbaum. He had four older siblings: Deborah (b. 1881), Harry (b. 1882), Sophie (b. 1883) and Jacob \"Jack\" (b. 1886).\n\nIn 1892 his parents took the family to his mother's native city in Austrian Poland, Przemyśl, where they worked as innkeepers. Though Louis was popular with his customers, mainly Austrian soldiers, the inn was a failure. One night without telling anyone Louis simply left for America (c.1893) in search of work. He eventually sent word to Golda telling her that once he was settled she was to bring the children to live with him there. However, this venture also failed and his family never joined him in America.\n\nInstead Louis returned to Britain, and had his family join him in London in 1896, when Marks' forename was anglicised as \"Mark\".\n\nFrom an early age Gertler showed signs of a great talent for drawing. On leaving school in 1906, he enrolled in art classes at Regent Street Polytechnic. Unfortunately, due to his family's poverty, he was forced to drop out after a year, and in December 1907 began working as an  apprentice at Clayton & Bell, a stained glass company. He disliked his work there and rarely spoke of it in later years. While there he attended evening classes at the Polytechnic. In 1908 Gertler was placed third in a national art competition; this inspired him to apply for a scholarship from the Jewish Education Aid Society (JEAS) to resume his studies as an artist. The application was successful. Upon the advice of the prominent Jewish artist William Rothenstein, in 1908 he enrolled at the Slade School of Art in London. During the four years he spent at the Slade, Gertler was a contemporary of Paul Nash, Edward Wadsworth, C. R. W. Nevinson, Stanley Spencer, Isaac Rosenberg, and Morris Goldstein, among others.\n\nDuring his time at the Slade, Gertler met the painter Dora Carrington, whom he pursued relentlessly for many years. His obsessive love for Carrington is detailed in his published letters (see bibliography below) and in Sarah MacDougall's book Mark Gertler. It is also represented in the feature  film Carrington (1995). His love for Carrington was unrequited, and she spent most of her life living with the homosexual author Lytton Strachey, with whom she was deeply in love. Carrington's unconventional relationship with Strachey, of whom Gertler was extremely jealous, and her eventual marriage to Ralph Partridge, destroyed her equally complex relationship with Gertler. He had been so distraught when he learned of Carrington's marriage that he tried to purchase a revolver, and threatened to commit suicide.\n\nCareer\n\nGertler's patron was Lady Ottoline Morrell, through whom he became acquainted with the Bloomsbury Group. She introduced him to Walter Sickert, the nominal leader of the Camden Town Group. Gertler was soon enjoying success as a painter of society portraits, but his temperamental manner and devotion to advancing his work according to his own vision led to increasing personal frustration and the alienation of potential sitters and buyers. As a result, he struggled frequently with poverty.\n\nIn 1914 the polymath art collector Edward Marsh became Gertler's patron. The relationship between the two men proved a difficult one, as Gertler felt that the system of patronage and the circle in which he moved were in direct conflict with his sense of self. In 1916, as World War I dragged on, Gertler ended the relationship due to his pacifism and conscientious objection (Marsh was secretary to Winston Churchill and patron to some of the war poets). Gertler's major painting, Merry-Go-Round, was created in the midst of the war years and was described by D. H. Lawrence as \"the best modern picture I have seen\".\n\nIn 1913 Gertler met the author and poet Gilbert Cannan, who later described him as \"a small passionate man with green eyes\". Cannan subsequently invited Mark to stay with him and his wife Mary at their Mill House in Cholesbury and the two men became good friends. Gertler lived there on and off during 1915–16, and painted Gilbert Cannan at his Mill (now on view in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford). The picture depicts Cannan outside the Mill with his two dogs. The black and white one, Luath, had been the inspiration for the dog Nana in the stage production of J. M. Barrie's Peter Pan. It was Cannan who was responsible for introducing Lady Ottoline Morrell to Gertler's paintings and encouraging her to support his work. Cannan closely based the young Jewish character of his 1916 novel Mendel on Gertler's early life including his infatuation and affair with fellow artist Dora Carrington. This relationship remained unfulfilled as Carrington spurned his numerous advances and instead declared her love for Lytton Strachey. The friendship of Cannan and Gertler waned after 1916, largely because of Cannan's increasingly unstable behaviour.\n\nVirginia Woolf recorded her impressions of Gertler after he came to visit her and her husband in Sussex in September 1918. As he left they cried, \n\"Good God, what an egoist!\" We have been talking about Gertler to Gertler for some 30 hours; it is like putting a microscope to your eye. One molehill is wonderfully clear; the surrounding world ceases to exist. But he is a forcible young man; if limited, able & respectable within those limits; as hard as a cricket ball; & as tightly rounded & stuffed in at the edges. We discussed—well, it always came back to Gertler. \"I have a very peculiar character ... I am not like any other artist ... My picture would not have those blank spaces ... I don't see that, because in my case I have a sense which other people don't have ... I saw in a moment what she had never dreamt of seeing ...\" & so on. And if you do slip a little away, he watches very jealously, from his own point of view, & somehow tricks you back again. He hoards an insatiable vanity. I suspect the truth to be that he is very anxious for the good opinion of people like ourselves, & would immensely like to be thought well of by Duncan [Grant], Vanessa [Bell] & Roger [Fry]. His triumphs have been too cheap so far. However this is honestly outspoken, & as I say, he has power & intelligence, & will, one sees, paint good interesting pictures, though some rupture of the brain would have to take place before he could be a painter.\n\nGertler's later works developed a sometimes very harsh edge, influenced by his increasing ill health. In 1920 he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, which forced him to enter a sanatorium on a number of occasions during the twenties and thirties. Two of Gertler's close friends, D. H. Lawrence and Katherine Mansfield, succumbed to the disease.\n\nIn 1930 Gertler married Marjorie Greatorex Hodgkinson, which resulted in the birth of a son, Luke Gertler, in 1932. The marriage was often difficult, punctuated by the frequent ill health of both, and with Gertler often suffering from the same feelings of constraint that destroyed his relationships with a number of friends and patrons.\n\nDuring the 1930s he became a part-time teacher at the Westminster School of Art in order to supplement his intermittent income from painting. He also undertook commercial work, including a series of posters for the Empire Marketing Board. A  still-life design by him of a fruit bowl was among the winning entries in the 1933 Famous Artists competition run by Cadbury's for a series of chocolate box designs and which were displayed at the Leicester Galleries in London.\n\nGertler gassed himself in his Highgate studio in 1939, having attempted suicide on at least one occasion in 1936.  He was suffering at the time from increasing financial difficulties, his wife had recently left him, he had held a critically derided exhibition at the Lefevre Gallery, he was still depressed over the death of his mother and Carrington's own suicide (both in 1932), and he was filled with fear over the imminent world war. He was buried at Willesden Jewish Cemetery.\n\nHe died at 5, Grove Terrace, Highgate, London, and left a modest estate, valued at only £361, the administration of which was granted to Marjorie Greatorex Kostenz.\n\nLegacy\nGertler's obituary in The Times described his death as \"a serious loss to British art. Opinions of his work are likely to vary\", it conceded, \"but it is safe to say that a considered list of the half-dozen most important painters under fifty working in England would include him\". Gertler's paintings are held in numerous public art collections, including in the Glasgow Museums. In June 2015 his 1912 painting The Violinist was auctioned for £542,500 at Christie's, London a record for the sale of his work.\n\nGertler's former house and studio in Elder Street, Spitalfields, bears a blue plaque erected by the Greater London Council in 1975; while set into the pavement in front of it is a cast-iron roundel created by sculptor Keith Bowler in 1995, depicting a detail from Gertler's Merry-Go-Round.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nSources\n\nExternal links \n\n \n\n1891 births\n1939 deaths\n1939 suicides\n20th-century English painters\n20th-century English male artists\n\nAlumni of the Slade School of Fine Art\nAlumni of the University of Westminster\nArtists who died by suicide\nBritish conscientious objectors\nBritish Jews\nBritish landscape painters\nBritish pacifists\nBritish people of Austrian-Jewish descent\nBritish portrait painters\nBurials at Willesden Jewish Cemetery\nEnglish male painters\nJewish pacifists\nJewish painters\nModern painters\nPainters from London\nPeople from Spitalfields\nSuicides by gas\nSuicides in Highgate, Greater London\nWhitechapel Boys",

        "A civil enforcement officer (CEO or colloquially traffic warden, parking enforcement officer, or parking attendant) is a person employed to enforce parking, traffic and other restrictions and laws.\n\nEngland & Wales\nIn England, they are employed by county councils, London borough councils, metropolitan district councils or Transport for London, and in Wales by county (borough) councils - or private companies contracted by any of the above. \nUntil the passage of the Traffic Management Act 2004, on-street parking and traffic movement violations were enforced by non-warranted police traffic wardens employed by constabularies. Off-street parking violations were enforced by parking attendants employed by local authorities and private companies.\n\nPowers of a Civil Enforcement Officer\nCivil enforcement officers may only exercise their functions when wearing a uniform authorised by the Home Secretary. \n\nTheir powers include:\n\nissue penalty charge notices for numerous offences (governed by civil law), either via a hand-held device or CCTV.\ninspect and confiscate disabled parking permits\ninterview motorists suspected of disabled badge fraud under caution\nimmobilise vehicles.\n\nPenalty charge notices are not criminal proceedings, and failure to pay will result in certificated bailiffs serving warrants of execution. They may issue penalties for several moving violations, among them driving in bus lanes, executing prohibited turns and driving the wrong way on a one way system.  \n\nCivil enforcement officers employed by some authorities issue fixed penalties for non-traffic offences using the community safety accreditation scheme of the Police Reform Act 2002.\n\nIn Wales, the Vale of Glamorgan Council employs \"dual role\" uniformed enforcement officers that are authorised to enforce both civil parking legislation, and criminal legislation with regard to environmental crime, anti-social behaviour, bylaws and public spaces protection orders.\n\nBelgium\nIn Belgium, municipalities use Stadswachten (City Guards); these public but civil officials can be compared to civil enforcement officers and can only write reports that are sent to a magistrate who decides if, according to the findings of the guards report, a fine will be issued. In Belgium, Stadswachten can be recognized by the purple jackets they wear.\n\nThe Netherlands\n\nIn the Netherlands municipalities used Stadswachten (City Guards) until 2004; these officers were public civil servants who patrolled the city but had no power to fine civilians. These days Stadswachten do not exist anymore, and the Guard departments were changed into Handhaving (Enforcement) units. Unlike the British City Wardens, Handhavers (Enforcers) do not have civil status but are fully public officials and have limited police powers. These officers are sworn BOA (Special Enforcement Officer) and have the powers to detain people to confirm their identity, search people for proof of identification or offensive or dangerous weapons (if arrested), investigate offences and certain crimes, issue fixed penalties, make warrantless arrests and use force with or without the use of weapons (baton, pepperspray). Most municipal enforcement officers (BOA) are equipped with handcuffs. Some cities also issue police batons to their officers. According to Dutch law, some BOA's can be equipped with pepperspray (cities of Utrecht and Amsterdam in 2016) and a handgun (cities of EDE and Enschede) if the necessity is proven by the city council and mayor. Also, BOA's working for the Dutch Correctional Services (Dienst Vervoer en Ondersteuning) who do transportation and guard duty for the Dutch Prisons are equipped with a baton, pepperspray and a handgun. They also support the Dutch police force whenever and where ever it is needed. Failure to comply with an order given by a BOA can result in arrest.\n\nIn 2014 the justice department ordered the creation of a national style uniform for BOAs employed by municipalities. Until that date, every city had its own uniform. The new uniform is based on the national police uniform but with a different color and unique element. The name used in this uniform is HANDHAVING and consist of a navy blue cargo pants, two colored polo shirts (navy and cobalt blue) with a checkered band across the chest. On the chest and on the back is the text \"Handhaving\" and on the sleeves are BOA patches which consist of a hand holding a scepter in front of a shield. Furthermore, officers wear Spanish-style police caps with a checker band and a metal BOA insignia on the front. Officers are allowed to wear high shoes with trouser legs twisted above them. Some cities issue officer anti stab vests in the same colors as the polo shirts, although a few cities use high-visibility yellow vests. A majority of large cities also use BOA bike patrol, motorcycle units (Amsterdam and Rotterdam), vehicle patrols in marked cars or plain clothes officers.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nLaw enforcement occupations in the United Kingdom",

        "Lyssa patroclus is a species of moth in the family Uraniidae. The species was described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae from the Moluccas.\n\nDescription\nUpperside: The antennae are about an inch (25 mm) long, slender, setaceous, and gradually diminishing from the base to the extremities. The head is small. The thorax is clothed with long soft hair, and, with the abdomen, is of a darkish brown. A remarkable straight narrow line, or bar, of a cream colour, arises from the middle of the anterior edge of each of the forewings, and, crossing both anterior and posterior wings, ends at the abdominal edges, about half an inch below the abdomen; so that, when the wings are extended, as in the figure, these lines, with the anterior edges, form an equilateral triangle. The space within the triangle is dark brown; but the parts, near the shoulders, are lighter, having a greyish cast or hue, and contain many small transverse curved streaks, extending to the anterior edges, where they are large, black, and very conspicuous, like stripes. Some transverse markings of this kind, are dispersed on the posterior edges of the superior wings, and also on the abdominal edges of the posterior. On the outside the triangle, both on the anterior and posterior wings, is a fascia, of light brown, about half an inch broad, which deepens into a dark brown. On the posterior wings, after becoming dark, it softens again into the same light colour, continuing to the external edges. Each of these wings is ornamented with two tails, the inner ones the longest and near an inch in length, the tips of which incline towards each other; the lesser or outer tails, are about half an inch long, strengthened by the tendons of the wings passing through the middle of them; all of them being bordered with a soft ray of dark brown.\n\nUnderside: The bars or lines, which form the triangle on the upperside, are not visible on this; but the inclosed triangular field appears of a light greyish brown, darker at the borders, and thickly beset with small brown streaks, parallel to each other, and surrounding the body. The costal nerve of the anterior wings composes an edging in each, about an eighth of an inch (3 mm) broad, which diminishes as it approaches the external angle, white, and beautifully marked with black streaks, but smaller than those seen on the upperside. Outside the triangle, both in the anterior and posterior wings, is a broad border of white, which softens into a brown, but lighter than that on the upperside. Both in the white, and in the brown, are some small dashes of black, very thinly dispersed. The internal margin of the posterior wings is furnished with a deep fringe, and the black marks situated below the abdomen, are larger and broader than those on the upperside. The tails are whitish, bordered with brown, and appear as on the upperside. Wingspan 6 inches (150 mm).\n\nReferences\n\nUraniidae\nMoths described in 1758\nTaxa named by Carl Linnaeus\nDescriptions from Illustrations of Exotic Entomology",

        "Mahaut or Matilda II of Boulogne (also known as Mathilde, Maud de Dammartin; 1202 – January 1259) was Countess of Boulogne in her own right and Queen of Portugal by marriage to King Afonso III from 1248 until their divorce in 1253. She was the daughter of Ida, Countess of Boulogne and her husband and co-ruler Renaud, Count of Dammartin. She succeeded her mother as Countess of Boulogne in 1216. She was the great-granddaughter of King Stephen of England.\n\nFirst marriage\nIn 1223, Matilda married her first husband, Philippe Hurepel, Count of Clermont-en-Beauvais, a younger, arguably illegitimate son of King Philip II of France. By marriage to her, Philippe became her co-ruler of Boulogne, Mortain, Aumale and Dammartin-en-Goële. Count Philippe revolted against his widowed sister-in-law, Blanche of Castile, when his half-brother King Louis VIII died in 1226.\n\nSecond marriage\nCount Philippe died in 1234, and Matilda reigned independently for three years. To give the county a male head, she married again in 1238 to Infante Afonso, second in line to the Portuguese throne, younger brother of King Sancho II of Portugal. He became King Afonso III of Portugal on 4 January 1248. At that time he renounced Boulogne.\n\nIn 1258, Matilda charged Afonso with bigamy, following his marriage to Beatrice of Castile. Pope Alexander in response, imposed interdict upon any place the couple stayed. At the time of Matilda's death, Afonso and Beatriz were still together, despite the Pope's protests.\n\nLater life\nShe had a son and a daughter with Count Philippe, but no surviving issue with Afonso.  Matilda's then apparent barrenness was the true reason for their divorce. According to reports, Queen Matilda remained in Boulogne and was not allowed to follow her husband to Portugal.\n\nMatilda's daughter, having married a lord de Châtillon-Montjay, predeceased her, and presumably left no surviving issue.\n\nHer son reportedly renounced his rights and went to England, for unknown reasons. Apparently he survived his mother the Countess, but presumably did not leave issue.\n\nShe was probably buried at the Cistercian Abbey of Gomerfontaine (nowadays in the French commune of Trie-la-Ville, in the Oise department).\n\nAncestry\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\n1202 births\n1259 deaths\nCounts of Boulogne\nQueens consort of Portugal\nMatilda\nMatilda\nMatilda\nCounts of Aumale\nMatilda\nCounts of Mortain\n13th-century French people\n13th-century Portuguese people\n13th-century women rulers\n13th-century French women\n13th-century Portuguese women",

        "The rock pratincole (Glareola nuchalis) is a species of bird in the family Glareolidae.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nThere are two subspecies of rock pratincole:\n\nG. n. liberiae (Schlegel, 1881), – Rufous-collared pratincole – from Sierra Leone to western Cameroon\nG. n. nuchalis (Gray, 1849), – White-collared pratincole – Chad to Ethiopia, south to southern Angola & northeast Namibia to western Zambia & Mozambique\n\nIdentification\nThe rock pratincole (Glareola nuchalis) is a native African wading bird. Mature adults have dark gray or brown plumage with a white line beginning beneath the eye extending to the back of the neck like a collar. Their wings are long and dark with a distinct white patch on the underwing. Their tail is forked and they usually have a white belly. The bill is black with a red base and the legs and eyes are coral red. Both sexes emit a faint whistling contact call and musical purring but can become very noisy when aggressive. Glareola nuchalis measurements: length: 16.5–19.5 cm; wing: 14.3–16.0 cm; bill: 10-12mm; tail: 5–6 cm; mass: 43–52 grams.\n\nHabitat\nGlareola nuchalis associates with the rocks along the embankments of rivers and lakes as its seasonal movements are determined by local water levels. These intra-African migrants occur peripherally along the coast of South Africa in the equatorial regions. They migrate when areas are flooded and arrive when rocks emanate during drought. They live in flocks of about 26 pairs in and on the rocks feeding upon insects in the morning and evening and wading in the cool waters during the heat of the day. They will feed during day if overcast is present and can be routinely seen perched on a hippopotamus scavenging for insects. Its diet consists mostly of flies, moths, ants, beetles, grasshoppers and cicadas. Their prey is attacked aerially.\n\nBreeding\nAn elaborate courtship occurs in flight with wings held high over the back with neck feathers flared to emphasize their collar. They are monogamous and keep the same mate for life. Breeding pairs withdraw from the flock and become territorial of their nest and only breed in times of drought. The female lays 1–2 eggs in the depression of a smooth rock in sites surrounded by water. Both sexes incubate the nest and frequently return to the nest with wet feathers to keep their eggs cool. Chicks are born camouflaged with brown feathers and white spots and have no white collar until it matures. They quickly take refuge in the crevices of rocks and begin swimming well quickly.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nImage at ADW\n Rock pratincole – Species text in The Atlas of Southern African Birds.\n\nrock pratincole\nBirds of Sub-Saharan Africa\nrock pratincole\nrock pratincole\nTaxonomy articles created by Polbot",

        "James Bond (January 4, 1900 – February 14, 1989) was an American ornithologist and expert on the birds of the Caribbean, having written the definitive book on the subject: Birds of the West Indies, first published in 1936. He served as a curator of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. His name was appropriated by writer Ian Fleming for his fictional British spy of the same name; the real Bond enjoyed knowing his name was being used this way, and references to him permeate the resulting media franchise.\n\nLife and career\nBond was born on January 4, 1900, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Margaret Reeves ( Tyson) and Francis Edward Bond. His interest in natural history was spurred by an expedition his father undertook in 1911 to the Orinoco Delta. Bond was educated at the Delancey School followed by St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, but after the death of his mother he moved with his father to the United Kingdom in 1914. There, he studied at Harrow and later Trinity College, Cambridge, where he obtained a B.A. in 1922 and was the sole American member of the Pitt Club.\n\nAfter graduating he moved back to the United States and worked for a banking firm for three years in Philadelphia. An interest in natural history prompted him to quit, and along with Rodolphe Meyer de Schauensee, took out a loan to set out on an  expedition to the Amazon to collect specimens for the Academy of Natural Sciences.\n\nSubsequently, he worked as an ornithologist at the Academy of Natural Sciences in Philadelphia, rising to become curator of ornithology there. He was an expert in Caribbean birds and wrote the definitive book on the subject: Birds of the West Indies, first published in 1936. From the 1920s to the 1960s, he took dozens of birding explorations to the West Indies.\n\nBond won the Institute of Jamaica's Musgrave Medal in 1952; the Brewster Medal of the American Ornithologists' Union in 1954; and the Leidy Award of the Academy of Natural Sciences in 1975. He died in the Chestnut Hill Hospital in Philadelphia at age 89. He is interred in the church yard at Church of the Messiah in Gwynedd Valley, Pennsylvania. Bond's wife, the author Mary  Fanning  Wickham Bond née Porcher, who wrote several memoirs about her husband, died in 1997.\n\nWorks\nOne of Bond's early work in ornithology was through his maternal uncle Carroll Sargent Tyson Jr. (1878–1956). After the death of his mother, Bond spent time with his uncle, out in the outdoors in Mount Desert Island, Maine. In 1916, Tyson was prompted, inspired by Audubon's works, to produce large folios of the birds of Maine. Bond collected specimens of birds for his uncle to paint. This resulted in the production of 250 copies of the book The Birds of Mt. Desert Island (1941) with 20 chromolithographs.\n\nBond's most enduring work was his guide to the Birds of the West Indies which was first published in 1936 and went into 11 editions during his lifetime. He published nearly 150 papers in various journals including descriptions of 63 new subspecies. His mother was a sister of the artist Carroll Sargent Tyson.\n\nJames Bond noted that the distribution of hutias was limited by what he thought may have been a marine boundary. In 1973 David Lack proposed that this be called Bond's Line, a biogeographical boundary between Tobago and the Lesser Antilles that also divided birds of North and South American origin. In 2015 a new subspecies of hutia was described as Plagiodontia aedium bondi and named after Bond for his recognition of the biogeographical divide.\n\nFictional namesake\n\nIan Fleming, who was a keen bird watcher living in Jamaica, was familiar with Bond's book, and chose the name of its author for the hero of Casino Royale in 1953, apparently because he wanted a name that sounded \"as ordinary as possible\". Fleming wrote to the real Bond's wife, \"It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born.\" He did not contact the real James Bond about using his name in the books, and Bond did not learn of Fleming's character until the early 1960s, when Fleming's James Bond books became popular in the U.S. In 1964 during Fleming's annual winter stay at Goldeneye in Jamaica, James Bond and his wife visited Fleming unexpectedly. In his novel Dr. No Fleming referenced Bond's work by basing a large ornithological sanctuary on Dr. No's island in the Bahamas. In 1964, Fleming gave Bond a first edition copy of You Only Live Twice signed, \"To the real James Bond, from the thief of his identity\". In December 2008 the book was put up for auction, eventually fetching $84,000 (£56,000).\n\nJames Bond's wife told Fleming that her husband saw the use of his name for the character as a good joke, to which Fleming replied \"I can only offer your James Bond unlimited use of the name Ian Fleming...Perhaps one day he will discover some particularly horrible species of bird which he would like to christen in an insulting fashion.\"\n\nIn 1966, James Bond's wife, Mary Fanning Wickham Bond, published a small book, \"How 007 Got His Name\".  It details her husband's life and discovery of the appropriation of his name along with their meeting Ian Fleming and the Hilary Brays at Goldeneye on February 5, 1964. By happenstance, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation was filming an interview that day.\n\nIn the 2002 Bond film Die Another Day, the fictional Bond, played by Pierce Brosnan, can be seen examining Birds of the West Indies in an early scene that takes place in Havana, Cuba. The author's name on the front cover is obscured. In the same film, when Bond first meets Jinx (Halle Berry), he introduces himself as an ornithologist. In the 2015 Bond film Spectre, the same book was seen in a promotional on-set photo, which is supposed to be appearing in an alternate take of a scene taking place in Bond's Chelsea apartment, though this is not in the final film.\n\nIn the ITV Miss Marple murder mystery \"A Caribbean Mystery\", broadcast on 16 June 2013, Miss Marple meets Ian Fleming at a talk on \"Birds of the West Indies\", given by James Bond. Before the talk begins, Fleming tells Miss Marple that he's working on a new book, but trying to come up with a name for the character. When the speaker introduced himself, Fleming has a moment of inspiration and reaches for his notebook, as the first few bars of the film theme play. The talk by the ornithologist James Bond is on guano which figures in the background and plot of the James Bond spy novel Dr. No. This instance of James Bond was played by Charlie Higson, who wrote the Young Bond novels.\n\nThe story of James Bond and his wife, Mary Fanning Wickham Bond, discovering Ian Fleming's theft of the name, before contacting and meeting Fleming at Goldeneye is told in the 2022 documentary The Other Fellow. The film chronicles the lives of several men named James Bond and shows a film, not previously broadcast, of the Bonds meeting Fleming, as well as interviews with James and Mary that were discovered by the film's director Matthew Bauer.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nExternal links\n\nAmerican ornithologists\n1900 births\n1989 deaths\nScientists from Philadelphia\nPeople educated at Harrow School\nAlumni of Trinity College, Cambridge\nRecipients of the Musgrave Medal\n20th-century American zoologists",

Its projects aimed to engage under-represented groups in volunteering such as minority groups and those not in education, employment, or training (NEET).\n\nHistory\nEstablished in May 2004 by the then Home Secretary, David Blunkett, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, The Russell Commission set out to develop a new national framework for youth action and engagement.\n\nHeaded by Ian Russell, the CEO of Scottish Power, the Commission aimed to deliver a step change in the diversity, quality and quantity of volunteering opportunities available to young people aged 16 to 25 in the UK. With help from its youth advisory board, the YABsters, the Commission engaged a wide range of stakeholders, including young people, the voluntary sector, business and the media, receiving over 700 responses from voluntary and community sector organisations, and a further 6,000 responses from young people.\n\nThe Commission’s headline recommendation was the creation of a dedicated implementation body, to take the lead in delivering the new framework in England – which was launched as v in May 2006, and changed its name to vinspired in January 2011.\n\nIt was announced in November 2018 that vinspired was to close with the loss of 20 jobs.\n\nProjects\nvinspired worked with over 500 voluntary sector organisations and over 150 private sector partners to create innovative youth volunteering opportunities.\n\nThe organisation also ran the following grants programmes: \nthe match fund\nvinvolved \nvTalent\n\nThe vinvolved Team Network\nLaunched in April 2008, vinvolved, the national youth volunteering programme, aims to get half a million more young people positively involved in their communities.*\n\nvinspired's England-wide network of 107 vinvolved teams ensured that young people and voluntary organisations could access expert advice and help.\n\nAs of March 2011, all vinvolved teams came to an end due to cut in government funding.\n\nReferences\n\nVolunteering in the United Kingdom\nCharities based in England\nYouth organisations based in the United Kingdom",

        "Vernon Simeon Plemion Grant (April 26, 1902 – July 9, 1990) was an American illustrator known for his whimsical gnome characters and fairy tale drawings. Over seven decades, Grant created hundreds of illustrations for advertising (General Electric, Gillette, Hershey's. Kellogg's) and major magazines, including Judge and Ladies' Home Journal. He is best known as creator of Kellogg's Rice Krispies cereal characters Snap! Crackle! and Pop!\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life and education \nGrant was born on April 26, 1902, in Coleridge, Nebraska, to Oliver Simeon Grant and Chloe Barkley Grant. When Grant was six years old, his family moved to South Dakota where they homesteaded. His experiences living on the prairies served as the inspiration for many of the artworks he would create throughout his career. While there he also learned illustration techniques from his beloved school teacher cousin Nellie Grant. As a teen, Grant moved with his family to California. He studied business law and public speaking at the University of Southern California and, at age 21, enrolled in the Art Institute of Chicago. To help pay for his education, Grant developed his chalk talks, which became a popular act on the vaudeville circuit.\n\nIllustrations \nIn 1932, a Grant Santa Claus illustration was used for the cover of Ladies' Home Journal. The next year, a radio commercial for Kellogg's Rice Krispies inspired the gnome-like mascots Snap! Crackle! and Pop! He soon became the lead illustrator for Kellogg's products, becoming so popular that in 1935 the company sent him on a world tour to promote their cereals.\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s Grant became one of the country's most popular and prolific illustrator of children's fairy tales, creating at least ten booklets and 25 individual prints. He did covers for Judge, Collier's and other magazines. In 1938, Life magazine ranked Grant as \"America's favorite children's artist.\"\n\nGrant worked with the USO during World War II, entertaining troops with sketches and fast-paced chalk talks. After the war, he moved to South Carolina while still working for New York clients.\n\nSouth Carolina farming \n\nIn 1936, Grant met and married Elizabeth Fewell, a native of Rock Hill, South Carolina. They had two children, son Chip and daughter Kay. In 1947, Grant and his family established a  farm outside Rock Hill, raising Angus cattle and Concord grapes. Grant became active in farming organizations, and his farming practices were recognized with awards from state agricultural associations.\n\nIn the late 1950s, Grant led the Rock Hill Chamber of Commerce, promoting changes in city planning and public housing. He served as the city's first director of public housing from 1965 to 1971.\n\nGrant continued making art until, in 1985, he felt he could no longer work to his own expectations and was forced to retire. When he died in 1990 at age 88, the Charlotte Observer noted that although Grant's illustrations would delight people for years, \"in the long run his greatest gift to the community may be the standard of citizenship he exemplified.\"\n\nInfluence and legacy\nIn his book Great Cartoonists and Their Art, political cartoonist Art Wood wrote:\n\nArchives\nThe Museum of York County has exhibited Grant's artwork since 1979. A permanent Vernon Grant Gallery was established at the Museum in 1990. In 2006, the Grant's family donated a collection of more than 1,000 items, including scrapbooks, studio furniture and original artwork, to the Culture & Heritage Museums which manages the Museum of York County. The Museum gift shop sells merchandise based on Grant art, including limited edition prints, books, Christmas ornaments, coloring books and playing cards.\n\nKellogg's Archives houses another substantial collection of original Grant artwork. In 1993, Kellogg's gave the Museum of York County reproduction rights to produce merchandise of art featured in the exhibition \"Seventy-five Years of Gnomes and Folks—A Tribute to Grant's Career\".\n\nFestivals \nIn the early 1960s, the city of Rock Hill created its Come-See-Me festival to feature the city's Glencairn Garden, with an owl drawn by Grant as a mascot. In 1965, Grant created Glen the Frog, which has been the festival mascot ever since. A new festival, ChristmasVille, was begun in Rock Hill in 2006. The festival spotlights Grant's many Santa Claus and winter illustrations. The festival mascot is Grant the Gnome.\n\nBibliography \nChildren's books written and/or illustrated by Vernon Grant.\n\nCitations\n\nGeneral and cited sources\n\nExternal links\n Vernon Grant's History—Museum of York County\n History of Snap, Crackle and Pop\n Culture & Heritage Museums: Vernon Grant\n ChristmasVille Holiday Festival\n Andrew Jackson Hotel / Vernon Grant Historical Marker\n Wall of Whimsy\n\n1902 births\n1990 deaths\nAmerican cartoonists\nArtists from Nebraska\nPeople from Cedar County, Nebraska\nPeople from Rock Hill, South Carolina",

        "John Raymond McCarl (November 27, 1879 – August 2, 1940) was an American lawyer and executive secretary of the national Republican Congressional Campaign Committee. He was the first Comptroller General of the United States, serving from 1921 to 1936. During his time in office, he was one of the most powerful and controversial officials in the U.S. federal government.\n\nEarly life and career\nMcCarl was born in a log cabin on November 27, 1879, near Des Moines, Iowa. His father was a veteran of the Union Army who fought in the American Civil War. John attended local public schools. McCarl's father died in 1893 at the age of 53.\n\nAfter her husband's death, Sara McCarl moved John and his five siblings to McCook, Nebraska. John held part-time jobs during the school year, and in the summers worked for the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad and local lawyer Webster Morlan. He was a halfback on the first football team fielded by McCook High School, and sang in a local vocal quartet.\n\nMcCarl graduated from McCook High School in 1897 and entered the University of Nebraska. He received a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Nebraska College of Law in 1903. McCarl returned to McCook, where he took up the practice of law. On November 26, 1905, he married Ethel Barnett, daughter of Albert Barnett (a McCook lumber yard owner and one of the wealthiest men in the state).\n\nGovernment career\n\nCongressional aide and GOP activism\nMcCarl was a Progressive Republican and active in party politics. In 1914, Fletcher Merwin resigned as private secretary to progressive Republican Senator George W. Norris (also from the town of McCook). On Merwin's recommendation, McCarl applied for and won the position.\n\nIn 1917, Norris opposed American entry into World War I. Worried that Norris would be denied renomination to the United States Senate in 1918, McCarl resigned. Norris was deeply disappointed in McCarl's decision. Senator Simeon D. Fess subsequently appointed McCarl to be secretary of the national Republican Congressional Campaign Committee (which Fess chaired). McCarl was highly active during the 1918 congressional elections, and made numerous political contacts during this time. He continued to work with the committee in the 1920 presidential election, leaving him well-positioned to seek a job with the incoming administration of Warren G. Harding.\n\nComptroller General\n\nSince the final year of the Taft administration (1912), pressure had been building within the Republican Party for legislation which would impose modern financial accounting and budgeting procedures on the federal government. Worsening national debt due to expenditures required by World War I and a greatly enlarged federal government led to passage of the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921. This legislation, which President Harding signed into law on June 10, 1921, created the Government Accounting Office (GAO), an independent agency answerable solely to Congress. The head of the GAO was the Comptroller General of the United States, a non-partisan position which could only be filled by the President of the United States with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Comptroller General served for a single, non-renewable, 15-year term.\n\nIt is unclear how McCarl won appointment as the first Comptroller General of the United States. Some sources say that McCarl advised Harding on who should fill the position, and that Harding chose McCarl. But other sources say that Senator Norris or Senator Fess pushed McCarl for the position. Although McCarl had no financial training or experience whatsoever, Harding nominated McCarl on June 28, 1921, and the Senate confirmed him the next day.\n\nHistorians Katie Louchheim and Jonathan Dembo note that McCarl had \"virtually unlimited power\" during his time in office. He was a decisive leader of the organization, asserted a broad range of powers for himself, and fought strongly to make GAO an impartial and independent agency. McCarl made a wide range of decisions on issues as diverse as individual expense accounts, salary increases, statutory authority to incur expenses, and the right of federal employees to receive reimbursement for their work clothes. He refused to authorize the expenditure of $100 million of Public Works Administration funds for slum clearance and declined to permit the Department of Agriculture to use drought relief funds for the purchase of surplus lambs as a means of price support. He argued that the law simply did not authorize such actions. He once voided contracts for the construction of the $12.5 million Arlington Memorial Bridge because they called for the hiring of a general contractor and not specific individuals, as he believed the law required. (Congress passed legislation changing the law.) His decisions were often highly controversial and he was widely unpopular within the government. He was very critical of the New Deal pushed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, claiming that New Deal agencies were set up hastily, spent far too much money, and had amorphous powers. He also criticized Congress for delegating too much authority to the executive branch. Political scientist Harvey Mansfield, writing in 1939, considered him a zealot and crusader when it came to accounting.\n\nEstablishing GAO\n\nMcCarl struggled to make GAO a competent and authoritative agency. In the first six years in office, he strictly controlled work start and stopping times, banned employees from discussing anything which was not work-related, and required employees to stay at their desks. He relaxed these rules significantly in 1927 after realizing they were harming staff morale.\n\nGAO was created out of the office of the Comptroller of the Treasury, and McCarl inherited most of that office's 1,700 workers. He largely retained the Treasury structure, although he concentrated approval authority for communication with Congress in his own office. He also created a legal office, and ordered that any interpretation of law issue only under his own signature. In 1922, he established a Bookkeeping Section to sign off on all government contractual expenditures, a Transportation Division to ensure that shipping costs were reasonable, and an Investigations Section to make investigations and inspections, write reports, and make recommendations regarding the operation and financial procedures of the federal government. This unit (later renamed the Office of Investigations in the late 1920s) quickly became the major arm of GAO.\n\nIn 1923, McCarl collapsed five of the GAO's existing divisions into just two, Civil and Military. These two divisions were further consolidated into a single Audit Division in 1926. He established a Records Division the same year.  This organizational structure existed largely unchanged until his departure from office (although Bookkeeping was renamed Accounting and Bookkeeping in 1935).\n\nMcCall was a constant critic of the lack of a central disbursing authority in the federal government. He believed that having a disbursing agent in each agency or department was a recipe for financial misappropriation. He applauded President Roosevelt's decision on June 10, 1933, to issue Executive Order 6166, which created a Division of Disbursement within the Treasury Department and eliminated this office within each agency.\n\nGAO historian Robert Trask says that McCarl was obstinate and harsh, but the Washington Post at the time of his death called him \"mild-mannered\".\n\nDeath\nAfter retiring as Comptroller General, McCarl practiced law in Washington, D.C. He suffered either a heart attack or a stroke at his desk in his law office on August 2, 1940, and died immediately. His wife, Ethel, survived him. The couple had no children.\n\nJohn R. McCarl was buried in McCook, Nebraska, at Memorial Park Cemetery.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nDowns, Winfield Scott. Encyclopedia of American Biography.

        "\"How Come U Don't Call Me Anymore?\" is a song by Prince. It is a ballad of romantic longing with some gospel elements. On his original recording of the song, which was released as the non-album B-side to his 1982 single \"1999\", Prince performs most of the song in his falsetto range, with his own bluesy piano playing providing the only instrumental accompaniment. The song's first album appearance was on his 1993 compilation The Hits/The B-Sides. It was later included on the soundtrack to the 1996 film Girl 6. Prince also performs the song on his 2002 live album One Nite Alone... Live!.\n\nArtists who have covered the song include Stephanie Mills (1983), Joshua Redman (1998), and Alicia Keys (2001). Bilal recorded the song which appears on his 2001 single \"Fast Lane\". Roger Cicero recorded the song with Soulounge for the 2004 album Home; a live version by Cicero is included on his 2008 single \"Alle Möbel verrückt\". American Idol season 11 finalist Jessica Sanchez performed the song on the American Idols LIVE! Tour 2012.\n\nAlicia Keys version\n\nRecording and production\nAlicia Keys recorded a cover of the song—retitled \"How Come You Don't Call Me\"—for her debut studio album Songs in A Minor (2001). She later told Billboard: \"I had never heard [the original] before. They gave me a copy of the song on tape. I played it every day for three weeks. It is so raw and so truthful – I was just feeling it. It really came out well.\"\n\nKeys' cover of \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" was inspired by a long-term relationship with a partner, and was produced by Keys alongside Kerry Brothers, Jr. An official remix of the song, produced by the Neptunes, was included on the Remixed & Unplugged in A Minor reissue of Songs in A Minor in 2002. It features vocals from Justin Timberlake towards the end of the track.\n\nMusic video\nThe accompanying music video for \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" was directed by Little X. It contains references to Japanese popular culture, such as San-X's Buru Buru Dog and Cardcaptor Sakuras Kero-chan, besides Korean character Mashimaro. The video starts with Keys waking up in the morning, and following her daily routine throughout the video, ending with a performance on stage. The video ends with a phone call from her supposed \"boyfriend\" (portrayed by Mike Epps) making an excuse about why he hasn't called her, and she hangs up on him, laughing.\n\nCritical reception\nMark Anthony Neal of PopMatters felt that the song was credible, but fell short from the original or Stephanie Mills' 1983 cover. Keys has said that Prince told her he loved her cover of the song.\n\nTrack listings and formats\nUK and Irish CD single and European promotional CD single\n \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Original Radio Version) – 3:31\t\n \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Neptunes Remix) – 4:23\n\nUK and Irish maxi CD single\n \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Original Radio Version) – 3:31\t\n \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Neptunes Remix) – 4:23 \t\n \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Live Version) – 5:18 \t\n \"Butterflyz\" (Roger's Release Mix) – 9:11 \t\n \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Video)\n\nEuropean maxi CD single\n \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Original Radio Version) – 3:31\t\n \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Neptunes Remix) – 4:23 \t\n \"Butterflyz\" (Roger's Release Mix) – 9:11 \t\n \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Video)\n\nAustralian and New Zealand maxi CD single\n \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Neptunes Remix) – 4:23 \n \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Original Radio Version) – 3:31\n \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Album Version) – 3:57\n \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Video)\n\nSpanish promotional CD single\n \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Remix) – 4:23 \n \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Radio Edit) – 3:31\n\nUS promotional CD single\n \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Radio Edit) – 3:31\n \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Instrumental) – 3:59\n \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Call Out Hook) – 0:10\n\nUS promotional CD single (Neptunes Remix)\n \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Radio Edit) – 4:23\n \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Instrumental) – 4:33\n \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Call Out Hook) – 0:10\n\nUS 12-inch vinyl\nA. \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Neptunes Remix – Main) – 4:21 \t\nB. \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Neptunes Remix – Instrumental) – 4:21\n\nUK 12-inch vinyl\nA1. \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Original Album Version) – 3:57\nA2. \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Neptunes Remix) – 4:23\t\t\nB1. \"Butterflyz\" (Roger's Release Mix) – 9:11\n\nUK promotional 12-inch vinyl\nA1. \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Neptunes Remix) – 4:23 \t\nA2. \"Troubles\" (Jay-J & Chris Lum Moulton Mix) – 8:59 \t\nB1. \"Butterflyz\" (Roger Sanchez Club Mix) – 9:11 \t\nB2. \"How Come You Don't Call Me\" (Live Version) – 3:10\n\nCredits and personnel\n Alicia Keys – lead vocals, backing vocals, production, all other instruments\n Kerry \"Krucial\" Brothers – production, drum programming\n Russ Elevado – mixing\n\nCharts\n\nRelease history\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nHow Come You Don't Call Me at Discogs\n\n1980s ballads\n1982 songs\n2002 singles\nAlicia Keys songs\nMusic videos directed by Director X\nPrince (musician) songs\nRhythm and blues ballads\nSong recordings produced by Prince (musician)\nSongs written by Prince (musician)\nStephanie Mills songs\nSoul ballads\nJ Records singles",

        "Cal Ripken's Real Baseball, also known as Real Baseball Online or Ultimate Baseball Online, was the first free-to-play baseball based massively multiplayer online sports game (MMOSG). Operating from 2003 until 2008, the game was developed and published by American company Netamin Communication Corporation. The game was designed to allow 18 human-controlled players to compete simultaneously in virtual game, though the number was later reduced due to lag issues. Former Major League Baseball player Darrell Evans served as the game's spokesperson/ambassador prior to Cal Ripken's endorsement of the game. After it ceased operation in 2008, a fan-led open source project was attempted before Real Baseball's successor, Big League Online, was released for beta testing in early 2011.\n\nDevelopment and history\nNetamin Communication Corporation was the developer behind Real Baseball Online, with the company having been founded in 1999. Netamin became the world's first company to develop the technology to build a Massively Multiplayer Online Sports Game (MMSOG), led by its founder and CEO (Chief Entertainment Officer), Andy Wang. The game entered live Beta testing in April 2004 and late in its development was associated with Disney/ESPN. Former Major League Baseball player Darrell Evans served as the game's \"Ambassador\" for the majority of its history until shortly after the ESPN deal was signed. After the release of Ultimate Baseball Online 2006 (known simply as UBO), the game had officially ended its Beta phase. Netamin announced a monthly subscription fee for UBO in September 2006, consisting of a $7.95 monthly fee for early adopters and a $9.95 monthly charge for new players. The subscription fee was met with negative reaction by players, prompting Netamin to create a new season and league system, while making the game free to play for those only participating in pickup baseball games.\n\nThe game still had its share of bugs and other issues, as explained in the download page on CNET.com.  Even though Disney/ESPN insisted the game get visual face lift, this introduced more problems than it solved and ultimately led to the game's demise.  Players angry over the subscription fees lashed out at what were known as \"General Managers\" or \"GM's\", people who worked for Netamin who overlooked games and tournaments online on the games message boards. Player reception to paid service led Netamin to try to find other ways to attract players and defray costs, eventually leading to in-game advertising.\n\nNetamin offered discounts to players who signed up for six months or one year subscriptions and gave away free months of subscriptions for winning in tournaments but nothing lured large enough numbers of players.  Netamin then tried to offer new players a limited time free play where they could download and play the game for free, but once they reached a certain level were forced to pay if they wanted to continue.  This also failed, and Netamin was at a loss to gain subscriptions. With seasoned players leaving the game and new player not sticking around to pay for the game, Netamin was forced to end subscription fees and once again offer the game to play for free.\n\nGameplay\n\nReal Baseball was a massively multiplayer online sports game capable of fielding up to 18 players a game, occupying all active positions in the game of baseball. However, players often refuse to field 18 due to lag and synchronization issues, and games rarely ended with all their original participants. This prompted a later revision in the game where Netamin only allowed ten human players total between two competing teams.  Game characters are based on a level of ranks for a specific range of levels, from 0-99, with 99 being the maximum level attained. The game-coded team names of Home and Away teams are used instead of the player created team names; therefore, players can play with each other in normal servers regardless of the team they belong. Servers are divided by players under level 10 and over level 11. Team play is only enforced however, as expected, in Team Tournaments and the UBO League. Game settings also allows the option day and night of three, six, and nine inning games, with extra innings if necessary in two stadiums.\n\nBatting power was supposed to be amplified through the addition of parameter points in body strength and stamina. Stamina was never implemented.\n\nRBO League\n\nReal Baseball Online (RBO) hosted seasonal leagues that featured multiple teams of different levels playing against each other for the championship. Managed by Netamin and Game Masters, there were three league classes: MVP, All-Star, and Major. Current Leagues include a 10-game regular season for all participating teams, 3-game wildcard playoffs, 4-game division finals, and a 5-game league championship for eligible teams. Press Coverage and Awards are also presented during the league seasons written by the official RBO players who are better off writing than playing the game. Winners of RBO Leagues qualified for the Best of RBO competition, which never took place.\n\nRBO Promotions\nHats, shirts, pens, keychains, and Darrell Evans autographed baseballs were given away as prizes for entering tournaments. Pay to play tournaments were added to fund prizes for the teams who entered. In-game advertisements were later added to fund future prizes such as \"The Best of UBO\" tournament that never happened. Players were also able to purchase higher leveled characters in the game. Past prizes included iPods, PSP's, Tickle Me Elmo dolls, Domino's Pizza, Michael J. Fox Bobbleheads, Giftcards, and level upgrades.\n\nReception\nThe game received a variety of press coverage, and some differing opinions about the game. Specifically for UBO 2006, GameShark rated it a \"B−\", while Operation Sports rated the game an \"8\". Additional reviews and press coverage included:\nAmped News\nGame Daily\nGame Spy\nGamesIndustry.biz\n\nShutdown and baseball MMOSG future\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = The service for Cal Ripken's Real Baseball is currently halted until further notice.

The main webpage of Real Baseball posted a statement saying, \"The service for Cal Ripken's Real Baseball is currently halted until further notice. We apologize for any inconvenience.\" Not long after, Netamin's own corporate webpage ceased to exist, cementing the demise of the game. A fan-initiated open-source project titled Multiplayer Baseball Online'' was in active development from about early 2009 until mid-2010, when the project was halted. Sometime during 2010 a new company carried over the previous Real Baseball game into a new endeavor called Big League Online. Big League Online soon went down as well, as nothing has been heard from the developers in over a year.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Big League Online, the official successor to Real Baseball\n Cal Ripken promotes Real Baseball\n\n2003 video games\nProducts and services discontinued in 2008\nMajor League Baseball video games\nMassively multiplayer online games\nWindows games\nWindows-only games\nVirtual reality games\nInactive massively multiplayer online games\nRipken\nRipken\nVideo games based on real people\nVideo games developed in the United States",

        "Tärnö is an island in the Blekinge archipelago, the largest and southernmost island in Hällaryd archipelago, in Karlshamn municipality, Blekinge County.\n\nGeography\nThe island measures 115.7 ha (285.9 acres) in surface.\nThe island boasts forty homesteads, now nearly all in use as summer residences.\n\nHistory\nThe island's population was once a farming and fishing community, to which many traces bear witness to this day. Tärnö was an important piloting centre during the first half of the 20th century. During that same period, cobblestones were hewn on the island for shipping to Germany and other countries. The island featured in a number of Per Gunnar Evander's novels.\n\nCommunications and Services\nFerry services to Tärnö are maintained from Karlshamn and from Matvik. Additionally, taxi boats frequent the island. A kiosk is found on the island serving simple food items and other necessities as well as a community centre which is rented out for summer camps and the like. The island's old teacher's residence is also rented out during summer, as are many smaller cottages, both municipally and privately owned.\n\nSights\nTärnö has two lighthouses. A large wooden one featuring a drum lens at the island's highest point was built in 1910 to replace a predecessor. The other one is a simple structure for guiding coastal fishery which only has a 40 Watt bulb. A known sight apart from the picturesque cottages and the unique  natural surroundings is the fiskgökaeken (a hollow centuries-old oak tree), a few Iron Age graves as well as a large naturally formed stone terrace. A number of military installations is still found on the island as a remnant of the time it formed part of the Swedish Navy's shooting range which made the island off-limits to all non-Swedes.\n\nReferences\nThis article is based on a full translation of the Swedish article on Tärnö\n\nIslands of Blekinge County",

        "The Principality of Valona and Kanina, also known as the Despotate of Valona and Kanina or simply the Principality of Valona (1346–1417) was a medieval principality in Albania, roughly encompassing the territories of the modern counties of Vlorë (Valona), Fier, and Berat. Initially a vassal of the Serbian Empire, it became an independent lordship after 1355, although de facto under Venetian influence, and remained as such until it was conquered by the Ottoman Turks in 1417.\n\nHistory \nThe strategically important city of Valona, on the coast of modern Albania, had been fought over repeatedly between the Byzantines and various Italian powers in the 13th century. Finally conquered by Byzantium in ca. 1290, it was one of the chief imperial holdings in the Balkans. Byzantine rule lasted until the 1340s, when the Serbian ruler Stefan Dušan, taking advantage of a Byzantine civil war, took Albania. Valona fell in late 1345 or early 1346, and Dušan placed his brother-in-law, John Asen, brother of the Bulgarian Tsar Ivan Alexander, in charge of Valona as his capital, and with Kanina and Berat as his main fortresses. According to some scholars, however, Dušan had captured Valona and Kanina already in 1337. The extent of John's authority over this territory is unclear; it is not known whether he was limited to the rule of these fortified cities, or whether his authority was more extensive, with the various local chieftains of central Albania reporting to him as a representative of Dušan.\n\nJohn was granted the rank of Despot by Dušan, and went on to solidify his control over his new territory by portraying himself as the heir to the Despots of Epirus. To that end, he married Anna Palaiologina, the widow of Despot John II Orsini, adopted the trappings of the Byzantine court, took on the surname \"Komnenos\" that was traditionally borne by the Epirote rulers, and signed his documents in Greek. After Dušan's death in 1355, John established himself as an independent lord. He maintained close relations with Venice (whose citizen he became) and with Simeon Uroš, ruler of Epirus in the south. Under his rule, Valona prospered through trade with Venice and the Republic of Ragusa (mod. Dubrovnik).\n\nJohn died in 1363 from the plague, and was succeeded by Alexander, possibly his son, who ruled until ca. 1368. He continued his father's policies, maintaining close ties with Ragusa, whose citizenship he acquired. In 1372, John's unnamed daughter was married to Balša II of the Serbian Balšić noble family, who received Valona, Kanina, Berat and Himara as a dowry. Many of Valona's citizens fled to the island of Saseno and asked for Venetian protection. Balša continued to expand his territory in the western Balkans, inheriting Zeta in 1378 and conquering Dyrrhachium from Karl Topia soon after, whereupon he assumed the title \"Duke of Albania\", probably after the former Venetian province of the same name. Thopia called on the Ottomans for help however, and Balša was killed in the Battle of Savra near Berat in 1385. His widow Komnina recovered control of her patrimonial territory, and ruled it thereafter jointly with her daughter Ruđina. Berat however had already fallen to the Muzaka, and their lordship was now confined to the area around Valona, with Kanina, Himara and the fort of Pyrgos.\n\nThe principality was now faced with the ever-increasing Ottoman threat; in 1386, Balša's widow offered to cede Valona to Venice in exchange for aid, but the Republic refused, since Valona alone without her hinterland was indefensible. Following the decisive Ottoman victory at the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, the situation became yet more precarious. A similar offer in 1393 was also rejected by a Venice anxious not to antagonize the Ottomans, but another, more comprehensive proposal, followed two years later. Through the bishop of Albania, the widow offered to the handover of the entire principality in exchange for a lifelong pension for her and her family of some 7,000 ducats drawn, from the principality's revenue (estimated at 9,000 ducats). Negotiations faltered after the widow's death in 1396. She was succeeded by Ruđina, who in 1391 had married Mrkša Žarković. According to Italian sources, the principality was called the Kingdom of Serbia during Mrkša'a period. Threatened by Ottoman expansion, both Balša's widow and Mrkša repeatedly offered to surrender Valona and their principality to the Venetians, but they refused or procrastinated. After Mrkša's death in 1414, he was briefly succeeded by his widow Ruđina, until the Ottomans took the city in 1417.\n\nThe Venetian bailo at Constantinople tried to obtain the return of  the territory to Ruđina, who was a Venetian citizen, or alternatively purchase it for the Republic with up to 8,000 ducats, but nothing came of it. With the exception of a brief Venetian occupation in 1690–91, the region remained under Ottoman rule until the First Balkan War and the establishment of an independent Albanian state.\n\nRulers\nJohn Komnenos Asen (1346–1363), Despot\nAlexander Komnenos Asen (1363–1372), Lord of Valona and Kanina\nBalša II Balšić (1372–1385), Lord of Kanina and Valona, and eventually Duke of Albania ()\n Komnina Balšić (1385–1396)\nMrkša Žarković (1396–1414), variously styled lord of Valona (), lord of Kanina () or King of Serbia ()\n Ruđina Balšić (1414–1417)\n\nSee also\n Albanian principalities\n History of Albania\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nSources \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\nMedieval Epirus\nAlbanian principalities\nSubdivisions of the Serbian Empire",
